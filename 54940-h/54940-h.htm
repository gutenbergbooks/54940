<h2 title="1. THE TREVLYNS OF CASTLE TREVLYN">CHAPTER THE FIRST.<br />

<small>THE TREVLYNS OF CASTLE TREVLYN.</small></h2>


<p>“Good-bye, Monica. I will look in again
to-morrow: but I assure you there is no
cause for anxiety. He is not worse than
usual, and will be better soon.”</p>

<p>The doctor was buttoning up his heavy
driving-coat as he spoke, and at the conclusion
of the sentence he opened the
heavy oak door, letting in a blast of cold
air and a sheet of fine, penetrating rain.</p>

<p>“Oh, Raymond, what weather! I ought
not to have sent for you.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>“Nonsense! You know I am weather-proof.
Old Jack will find his way home,
if I cannot. Good-bye again.”</p>

<p>The door closed upon the stalwart figure,
and Lady Monica Trevlyn was left standing
alone upon the wide staircase, amid the
gathering shadows of the great hall.</p>

<p>Castle Trevlyn was, in truth, a sufficiently
grim and desolate place, both within and
without. Tangled park, dense pine woods,
and a rocky iron-bound coast surrounded
it, cutting it off, at it were, from communication
with the outside world. Within its
walls lay a succession of vast, stately
chambers, few of them now inhabited—regions
where carved black oak, faded
tapestry, rusty armour, and antique relics
of bygone days seemed to reign in a sort
of mournful grandeur, telling their own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>tale of past magnificence and of present
poverty and decay.</p>

<p>Yes, the Trevlyns were a fallen race; for
the past three generations the reigning earl
had been poor, and the present Lord
Trevlyn had failed to do anything towards
restoring the decaying fortunes of his
house. He too was very poor, hence the
air of neglect that reigned around and
within the castle.</p>

<p>Monica, however, his only child, was
far too well used to the gloom and grimness
of the old castle to be in the least
oppressed by it. She loved her lonely,
desolate home with a curious, passionate
intensity, and could not picture anything
more perfect than the utter
silence and isolation that hemmed in
her life. The idea of desiring a change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>had never so much as occurred to
her.</p>

<p>Monica was very beautiful, with a beauty
of a rare kind, that haunted the memory
of those who saw her, as a strain of music
sometimes haunts the ear. Her face was
always pale and grave, and at first sight
cold even to hardness, yet endued with an
underlying depth and sweetness that often
eluded observation, though it never failed
to make itself felt. It was a lovely face—like
that of a pictured saint for purity of
outline, of a Greek statue for perfection
of feature—almost as calm and colourless
as marble itself. Yet, behind the statuesque
severity lay that strange, sad,
wistful sweetness which could not quite be
hidden away, and gave to the beholder
the idea that some great trouble had over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>shadowed
the girl’s life. Let us go with
her, and see what that trouble was.</p>

<p>When the door closed upon Raymond
Pendrill, she stood for a moment or two
silent and motionless, then turned and
mounted the shallow stairs once more, and,
passing down a long corridor, opened the
door of a fire-lit room, and entered
softly.</p>

<p>The room had two tenants: one, a great
mastiff dog, who acknowledged Monica’s
entrance by gently flopping his tail against
the floor; the other, a lad of seventeen,
who lay upon an invalid couch, his face
very white and his brows drawn with
pain.</p>

<p>As Monica looked at him her face
quivered, and a look of unspeakable
tenderness swept over it, transfiguring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>it for the moment, and showing wonderful
possibilities in every line and curve. She
bent over him, laying one cool, strong hand
upon his hot head.</p>

<p>“Better, Arthur?”</p>

<p>“Yes, getting better. That stuff Raymond
gave me is taking the pain away.
Stir up the fire, and sit where I can see
you. I like that best.”</p>

<p>Arthur Pendrill, cousin to Raymond
Pendrill, the young doctor who had just
left the castle, was the only child by a
first marriage of Lord Trevlyn’s second
wife. Hoping for an heir, the earl
had married again when Monica was
seven years old, but his hopes had not
been realised, and the second Lady Trevlyn
had died only a few years after her union
with him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<p>Arthur, who had been only a mite of
two years old when he first came to Castle
Trevlyn, knew nothing, of course, of any
other home; and he and Monica had grown
up like brother and sister, and were
tenderly attached, perhaps all the more
so from radical differences of character
and temperament. Their childhood had
been uncloudedly happy; they had enjoyed
a glorious liberty in their wild Cornish
home that could hardly have been accorded
to them anywhere else. Monica’s
had always been the leading spirit; physically
as well as mentally, she had always
been the stronger; but he adored her, and
emulated her with the zeal and enthusiasm
of youth. He followed her wherever she
led like a veritable shadow, until that
fatal day, five years ago, which had laid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>him upon a bed of sickness, and had
turned Monica in a few hours’ time from a
child to a woman.</p>

<p>Upon that day there had been a terrible
end to the mad-cap exploits in cliff-climbing
in which the girl had always
delighted, and Arthur had been carried
back to the castle, as all believed, to die.</p>

<p>He did not die, however, but recovered
to a suffering, helpless, invalid life; and
Monica, who held herself sternly responsible
for all, and who had nursed him with
a devotion that no mother could have
surpassed, now vowed deep down in her
heart that her own life should henceforth
be devoted to him, that for him she would
in future live, and that whatever she could
do to lighten his load of pain and make
his future happier should be done, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>whatever cost to herself, as the one atonement
possible for the rashness which had
cost him so dear.</p>

<p>Five years ago that vow had been
recorded, and Monica, from a gay, high-spirited
girl, had grown into a pale, silent,
thoughtful woman; but she had never
wearied of her self-imposed charge—never
faltered in her resolution. Arthur was
her special, sacred charge. Anything that
would conduce to his welfare and happiness
was to be accomplished at whatever cost.
So far, to tend and care for him had
been her aim and object of life, and
her deep love had made the office
sweet. It had never occurred to her that
any contingency could possibly arise by
which separation from him should prove
the truest test of her devotion.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>Whilst Arthur and Monica were dreaming
their own dreams upstairs, by the light
of his dancing fire, no thought of coming
changes clouding the horizon of their
imagination, downstairs, in the earl’s study,
a consultation was being held between him
and his sister which would have startled
Monica not a little had she heard it.</p>

<p>Lord Trevlyn was a tall, stately, grey-headed
man of sixty, with a finely-chiselled
face and the true Trevlyn cast of countenance
that his daughter had inherited. His
countenance wore, however, a look of pallor
and ill-health that, to a practised eye, denoted
weakness of the heart, and his figure
had lost its old strength and elasticity, and
had grown thin and a little bowed. His
expression had much of gentleness mingling
with its pride and austerity, as if, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>the advance of years, his nature had
softened and sweetened, as indeed had
been the case.</p>

<p>Lady Diana, on the other hand, had
grown more sharp and dictatorial with
advancing age. She was a “modish”
old lady, who, although quite innocent of
such adornments, always suggested the
idea of powder and patches, high-heeled
shoes and hoops. She generally carried a
fan in her hand, dressed richly and
quaintly, and looked something like a
human parrot, with her hooked nose, keen
black eyes, and quick, sharp voice and
movements. She had an independent and
sufficient income of her own, and divided
her time between her London house and
her brother’s Cornish castle. She had
always expressed it as her intention to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>provide for Monica, as her father could
do little for his daughter, everything
going with the entail in the male line; but
there was a sort of instinctive hostility between
aunt and niece, of which both were
well aware, and Lady Diana was always
deeply offended and annoyed by Monica’s
quiet independence, and her devotion to
Arthur.</p>

<p>It was of Monica they were talking this
boisterous autumn evening.</p>

<p>“She has a sadly independent spirit,”
remarked Lady Diana, sighing, and fanning
herself slowly, although the big panelled
room was by no means warm. “I often
think of her future, and wonder what will
become of her.”</p>

<p>Lord Trevlyn made no immediate response,
but by-and-by said slowly:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>“I have been thinking of late very
seriously of the future.”</p>

<p>“Why of late?” was the rather sharp
question.</p>

<p>“I have not been feeling so well since
my illness in the spring. Raymond Pendrill
and his brother have both spoken
seriously to me about the necessity for
care. I know what that means—they
think my state critical. If I am taken,
what will become of Monica?”</p>

<p>“I shall, of course, provide for her.”</p>

<p>“I know you will do all that is kind
and generous; but money is not everything.
Monica is peculiar: she wants
controlling, yet——”</p>

<p>“Yet no one can control her: I know
that well; or only Arthur and his whims.
She has no companions but her dogs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>horses. My blood runs cold every time I
see her on that wild black thing she
rides, with those great dogs bounding
round her. There will be another shocking
accident one of these days. She ought to
be controlled—taken away from her extraordinary
life. Yet she will not hear of
coming to London with me even on a short
visit; she will not even let me speak of it,”
and Lady Diana’s face showed that she was
much affronted.</p>

<p>“That is just it,” said Lord Trevlyn,
slowly; “her life and Arthur’s both seem
bound up in Trevlyn.”</p>

<p>Lady Diana made a significant gesture,
which the earl understood.</p>

<p>“Just so; and yet—unless under most
exceptional circumstances—unless what I
hardly dare to hope should happen—she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>must, they must both leave it, at some not
very distant date.”</p>

<p>The hesitation of Lord Trevlyn’s manner
did not escape his sister.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>“I mean that I have been in correspondence
lately with my heir, and that I
expect him shortly at Trevlyn.”</p>

<p>“Your heir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Randolph Trevlyn, one of the
Warwickshire branch. The extinction of
the Trevlyns at Drayton last year, you
know, made him the next in succession. I
made inquiries about him, and then entered
into personal communication.”</p>

<p>Lady Diana looked keenly interested.</p>

<p>“What have you made out?”</p>

<p>“That he is very well spoken of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>where
as a young man of high character
and excellent parts. He is wealthy—very
wealthy, I believe, an only son, and enriched
by a long minority. He is six or
seven and twenty, and he is not married.”</p>

<p>Lady Diana’s eyes began to sparkle.</p>

<p>“And he is coming here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, next week. Of course I need not
tell you what is in my thoughts. I object
to match-making, as a rule. I shall put no
pressure upon Monica of any kind, but if
those two should by chance learn to love
one another, I could say my ‘Nunc
dimittis’ at any time.”</p>

<p>Lady Diana looked very thoughtful.</p>

<p>“Monica is undoubtedly beautiful,” she
said, “and she is interesting, which perhaps
is better.” Her brother, however, made
no reply, and as he did not appear in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>clined
to discuss the matter farther—they
were seldom in entire accord in talking of
Monica—she presently rose and quitted the
room, saying softly to herself as she did so,
“I should love to see that proud girl with
a husband’s strong hand over her.”</p>

<p>That evening, when alone with his
daughter, Lord Trevlyn introduced the
topic most in his thoughts at that time.</p>

<p>“Monica, do you never want a little
variety? What should you say to a visitor
at Trevlyn?”</p>

<p>“I would try to make one comfortable.
Are you expecting anyone, father?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a kinsman of ours: Mr. Trevlyn,
whose acquaintance I wish to make.”</p>

<p>“Who is he? I never heard of him
before.”</p>

<p>“No; I have not known much about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>him myself till lately, when circumstances
made him my heir. Monica, have you
ever thought what will happen at Trevlyn
in the event of my death?”</p>

<p>A very troubled look crept into Monica’s
dark, unfathomable eyes. Her face looked
pained and strained.</p>

<p>“I think you ought to know, Monica,”
said the earl, gently. “Perhaps you have
thought that the estates would pass to you
in due course of time.”</p>

<p>Monica pressed her hands closely together,
but her voice was steady, her words
were quietly spoken.</p>

<p>“I do not know if I have ever thought
about it; but I suppose I have fancied you
would leave all to Arthur or to me.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, you would naturally inherit
all I have to leave; but Trevlyn is entailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>in the male line, and goes with the title.
At my death Mr. Randolph Trevlyn will be
the next earl, and all will be his.”</p>

<p>Monica sat very still, feeling as if she
had received some sudden stunning blow;
but she could not take in all in a moment
the gist of such intelligence. A woman in
some matters, she was a child in others.</p>

<p>“But, father,” she said quietly, and
without apparent emotion, “Arthur is
surely much nearer to you than this Mr.
Trevlyn, whom you have never seen?”</p>

<p>The earl smiled half-sadly, and shook his
head.</p>

<p>“My dear, you do not understand these
things; I feel towards Arthur as if he were
my son, but he is not of my kindred. He
is my wife’s son, not mine; he is not a
Trevlyn at all.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<p>Monica’s troubled gaze rested on her
father’s face.</p>

<p>“He cannot live anywhere but at
Trevlyn,” she said, slowly. “It would kill
him to take him anywhere else;” and in
her heart she added—a little jealous
hostility rising up in her heart against the
stranger and usurper who was coming—“He
<em>ought</em> to have it. He is a son and a
brother here. By every law of right
Trevlyn should be his.”</p>

<p>Foolish, irrational Monica! Where
Arthur was concerned her eyes were
blinded, her reason was warped by her
love. And the ways of the great outside
world were so difficult to understand.</p>

<p>Presently she spoke in very low,
measured tones, though not without a
little falter in her voice now and then.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>“You mean that if—if you were to die—Arthur
and I should be turned out of
Trevlyn.”</p>

<p>“You would neither of you have any
right to remain,” answered Lord Trevlyn,
choosing his words with care. “You
would find a home with your aunt; and
as for Arthur, I suppose he would go to
his cousins—unless, indeed, if he seemed
unable to live away from the place, some
arrangement with my successor could be
made. Everything would depend on him,
but of course it would be a difficult
arrangement.”</p>

<p>She drew a long breath, and passed her
hand across her eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Trevlyn is coming here, you
say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, next week. I think it is right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>that we should become acquainted with
our kinsman, especially as so much may
depend upon him in the future.”</p>

<p>“I think so too,” answered Monica; and
then she quietly left him, without uttering
another word.</p>

<h2 title="2. MONICA’S RIDE">CHAPTER THE SECOND.<br />

<small>MONICA’S RIDE.</small></h2></div>


<p>The next morning dawned fair and clear,
as is often the case after a storm. Monica
rose early, her first thought, as usual, for
Arthur. She crept on tip-toe to his room,
to find him as she had left him, sleeping
calmly—as he was likely now to do for
hours, after the attack of the previous day;
and finding herself no longer required by
him, the girl was not long in making up
her mind how these early hours of
glimmering daylight were to be spent.</p>

<p>Seven o’clock found her in the saddle,
mounted on her glossy black thorough-bred,
who, gentle under her hand, would brook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>no other rider, and showed his mettle in
every graceful eager movement, and in
the restless quivering of his shapely limbs.
His coat shone like satin in the pale early
sunlight; he pranced and curvetted as he
felt his rider upon his back. Monica and
her horse together made a picture that for
beauty and grace could hardly meet its
match in the length and breadth of the
land.</p>

<p>The girl was perfectly at home in the
saddle. She heeded no whit the pawing of
her steed, or the delighted baying of the
great hounds who formed her escort, and
whose noise caused Guy’s delicate nerves
many a restive start. She gathered up her
reins with practised hand, soothed him by
a gentle caress, and rode quietly and
absently out of the great grass-grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>court-yard and through a stretch of
tangled park beyond. Once outside the
gates, she turned to the right, and quickly
gained a narrow grass-grown track, which
led for miles along the edge of the great
frowning cliffs that almost overhung at a
giddy height the tossing ocean far below.
It was a perilous-looking path enough—one
false step would be enough to hurl
both horse and rider to certain destruction,
but Monica rode fearlessly onward; she
and her horse were familiar with every step
of the way, both knew the wild cliff path,
and both loved it; and Guy stretched his
delicate supple limbs in one of those silent
gallops over the elastic turf in which his
heart delighted.</p>

<p>Monica seldom passed more than a day
without traversing that well-known track.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>She loved to feel the fresh salt wind as it
blew off the sea and met her face. Sometimes
it was warm and tender as a caress,
sometimes fierce and boisterous, a wet,
blinding blast, laden with spray from the
tempest-tossed waves below; but to-day it
was a keen, fresh wind, salt, and strong,
and life-giving—a wind that brought the
warm colour to her cheek, the light to her
eye and gave a peculiar and indescribable
radiance to her usually cold and statuesque
beauty.</p>

<p>To-day she felt strangely restless and
uneasy. A sort of haunting fear was upon
her, a presentiment of coming trouble,
that was perhaps all the harder to bear
from its very vagueness. She had never
before realised that the future would bring
any change to the course of her life, save
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>that of gradually increasing age. Not for
an instant had it ever occurred to her that
a possibility such as that hinted at last
night by her father could by any chance
arise. That she and Arthur might ever
have to leave Trevlyn seemed the wildest
of all wild dreams, and yet that is what in
all probability must happen in the event of
her father’s death. Monica shuddered at
the bare idea. Her beautiful dark eyes
glowed strangely. It must not, it should
not be. It would be too cruel, too hard,
too unjust!</p>

<p>In deep abstraction, Monica rode along
the cliff for some three miles, then turning
her horse’s head inland, she crossed an
open space of wind-swept down, leaped a
low stone wall, and found herself in a road,
which she followed for some considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>distance. It led at length to the quaint
little town of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maws, a pretty little
place, nestling down in a wooded hollow,
and intersected by a narrow inlet from the
sea, which was spanned by a many-arched
bridge. All the trees in the neighbourhood
seemed to have collected round <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maws,
and its inhabitants were justly proud of
their stately oaks and graceful beeches.</p>

<p>Monica rode quietly through the empty
streets, returning now and again a salutation
from some tradesman or rustic. It was
still early—only eight o’clock—and the
sleepy little place was slowly awaking
from its night’s repose. At the far end of
the town stood a good-sized house, well
hidden from view behind a high brick
wall. Guy turned in at the gate of his
own accord, and, following a short, winding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>carriage drive, halted before the front door.
The house was of warm red brick, mellowed
by age; there was an indescribable air of
comfort and hospitality hanging over it.
It was mantled by glossy ivy, and its gables,
steep pitched roof, and twisted chimneys
were charmingly picturesque. The door
stood wide open as if to invite entrance.
Monica’s hounds had already announced
her approach, and a tall, wiry-looking
man of some thirty summers was standing
upon the threshold. He was not much
like his brother, the blue-eyed, brown-bearded
Raymond, having a thin, sharp,
closely-shaved face, very keen penetrating
eyes, and a cynical mouth. Tom Pendrill
was himself a doctor, like his brother; but
he did not practise on his own account,
being a man of scientific predilections, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>a taste for authorship. His college
fellowship rendered him independent of
lucrative employment, and, save for assisting
his brother with critical cases, his time
was spent in study and research.</p>

<p>“Well, Monica, you are abroad early
to-day,” was his greeting. Arthur’s
cousins had been like cousins to Monica
almost ever since she could remember.
“You have come to breakfast, of
course?”</p>

<p>“I came to tell Raymond not to trouble
to call at Trevlyn to-day, if he is busy.
Arthur is much better. I want to see
Aunt Elizabeth; but I should like some
breakfast very much.”</p>

<p>“I will take your horse,” said Tom, as
the girl slipped from the saddle. “You will
find Aunt Elizabeth in the breakfast-room.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p>The “Aunt Elizabeth” thus alluded to
was the widow of the Pendrills’ uncle,
and she had lived with them for many
years, keeping their house, and bringing
into it that element of womanly refinement
and comfort which can never
be found in a purely bachelor establishment.
The young men were both warmly
attached to her, as was her other nephew,
Arthur, at the Castle. As for Monica,
“Aunt Elizabeth” had been to her almost
like a mother, supplying that great want
in the girl’s life of which she was only
vaguely conscious—the want of tender
womanly comprehension and sympathy in
the trials and troubles of childhood and
youth.</p>

<p>It had been her habit for many years to
bring all her troubles to Mrs. Pendrill.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>She did not discuss them with Arthur.
Her mission was to soothe and cheer him,
not to infect him with any fears or sorrows.
He was her boy, her charge, her dearly-loved
brother, but Aunt Elizabeth was her
confidant and friend.</p>

<p>She was a very sweet-looking old lady,
with snow-white hair, and a gentle, placid,
earnest face. She greeted Monica with a
peculiarly tender smile, and asked after
Arthur with the air of one who loved
him.</p>

<p>“He is better,” said Monica, “much
better, or I could not have come. He is
asleep; he will most likely sleep till noon.
I want to talk to you, Aunt Elizabeth. I
felt I must come to you. When breakfast
is over, please let us go somewhere
together. There is so much I want to say.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>When they found themselves at length
secure from interruption in Mrs. Pendrill’s
pretty little parlour, Monica stood very
quiet for a minute or two, and then turning
abruptly to her aunt, she asked:</p>

<p>“Is my father very much out of
health?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pendrill was a little startled.</p>

<p>“What makes you ask that, my love?”</p>

<p>“I can hardly say—I think it is the way
he looked, the way he spoke. Please tell
me the truth, dear Aunt Elizabeth. I have
nobody but you to turn to,” and there was
a pathetic quiver in the voice as well as in
the pale, sweet face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pendrill did not try to deceive her.
She knew from both her nephews that Lord
Trevlyn’s health was in a very precarious
state, and she loved Monica too well not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>wish to see her somewhat prepared for a
change that must inevitably fall upon her
sooner or later. She had always shrunk
from thinking of this trouble, she shrank
from bringing it home to Monica now; but
a plain question had been asked, and her
answer must not be too ambiguous.</p>

<p>Monica listened very quietly, as was her
wont, not betraying any emotion save in
the strained look of pain in her great dark
eyes. Then very quietly, too, she told Mrs.
Pendrill what her father had said the previous
evening about his heir, and about
the prospective visit.</p>

<p>“Aunt Elizabeth,” said Monica suddenly
after a long pause, betraying for the first
time the emotion she felt, “Aunt Elizabeth,
I do not wish to be wicked or ungenerous,
but I <em>hate</em> that man! He has no right to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>be at Trevlyn, yet he will some day come
and turn out Arthur and me. I cannot
help hating him for it; but oh, if only he
would be good to Arthur, if only he would
let him stay, I could bear anything else I
think. <em>Do</em> you think he would be
generous, and would let him keep his own
little corner of the Castle? It does not
seem much to ask, yet father thought it
might be difficult. Arthur is so patient, so
good, he might learn to love him—he
might even adopt him, so to speak. Am I
very foolish to hope such things, Aunt
Elizabeth?—they do not seem impossible
to me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pendrill mused a little while.</p>

<p>“Has this Mr. Trevlyn any family?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. Father did not speak
of a wife. I fancy he is an old bachelor.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<p>“He is old, then?”</p>

<p>“I fancy he is elderly, or at any rate
middle-aged, or father would hardly care
to have him on a visit. He must be
younger than father, of course, but I do
not know anything more about him. Oh,
it will be very hard; but if he will only be
good to Arthur, I will try to bear the rest.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you will, my Monica,” said
Mrs. Pendrill tenderly. “I am sure you
will never be ungenerous or act unworthily.
A dark cloud seems hanging over your life,
but there is light behind, though we
cannot always see it. And, remember, my
darling, that gold shines all the brighter
for having been tried in the furnace.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“I know the fellow,” said Tom Pendrill,
an hour later, when Monica had gone, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>he had heard from his aunt part of what
had passed between them. “Monica is out
about his age; he can’t be more than six
or seven and twenty, and a right good
fellow he is too, and would make my lady
a capital husband, if he is not married
already. Randolph Trevlyn was at Oxford;
I knew him there pretty well, though he was
only an undergraduate when I had taken
my degree. The name sounded home-like,
and I made friends with him. He
wasn’t anywhere near the title then, but I
suppose there have been deaths in the
family since. Well, well, the earl is quite
right to have him down, and if he could
manage to fall in love with Monica and
marry her, it would simplify matters
wonderfully; but that wild bird will need
a good deal of training before she will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>come at a husband’s call, and there is such
a thing as spreading the snare too much
in the sight of the quarry.”</p>

<p>No thought of this kind, however,
entered into Monica’s head. She was far
too unversed in the ways of the world to
entertain the smallest suspicion of the
hopes entertained on her account. She
thought a good deal of the coming guest
as the days went by—thought of him with
bitterness, with aversion, with mistrust, but
in the light of a possible husband—never
for a single instant.</p>

<p>It was the day before the stranger was
expected, and Monica, as the sun was
sinking in the sky, was riding alone in the
pine wood that surrounded the Castle.
She was grave and pre-occupied, as she
had been for the week past, haunted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>by the presage of coming sorrow and
change. Her face was pale and sad, yet
there was a wonderful depth of sweetness
in its expression of wistful melancholy.
The setting sun, slanting through the ruddy
trunks of the tall pines, shone full upon
her, lighting her golden hair, and making
an aureole of glory round her head,
showing off with peculiar clear distinctness
the graceful outline of her supple figure
and the beauty of the horse she rode.</p>

<p>She was in a very thoughtful mood, so
absent and pre-occupied as to be quite lost
to outside impressions, when Guy suddenly
swerved and reared, with a violence that
would have unseated a less practised rider.
Monica was not in the least alarmed, but
the movement aroused her from her
reverie, and she was quickly made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>aware of what had frightened the
horse.</p>

<p>A tall, broad-shouldered young man
stepped forward, and laid a hand upon
Guy’s bridle, lifting his hat at the same
time, and disclosing a broad brow, with a
sweeping wave of dark hair lying across it.</p>

<p>“I beg a thousand pardons; I believe I
frightened your horse. He is evidently
unused to the sight of trespassers. I trust
you have not been alarmed.”</p>

<p>Monica smiled at the notion; her face
had been somewhat set and cold till the
apology had been made. The stranger
had no right to be there, certainly, but his
frank admission of the fact went far to
palliate the crime. She allowed herself to
smile, and the smile was in itself a revelation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p>“It does not matter,” she said quietly.
“I know the wood is perplexing; but if
you keep bearing to the west you will
find the road before long. No, I was
not frightened, thank you. Good afternoon.”</p>

<p>She bent her head slightly, and the
stranger uncovered again. He was smiling
now, and she could not deny that he was
very good-looking, and every inch the
gentleman.</p>

<p>She had not an idea who he was
nor what he could be doing there; but
it was no business of hers. He was
probably some tourist who had lost his
way exploring the beauties of the coast.
She was just a little puzzled by the look
his face had worn as he turned away:
there was a sort of subdued amusement in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>the dark blue eyes, and his long brown
moustache had quivered as if with the
effort to subdue a smile. Yet there had
been nothing in the least impertinent in his
manner; on the contrary, he had been
particularly courtly and polished in his
bearing. Monica dismissed the subject
from her mind, and rode home as the sun
dipped beneath the far horizon.</p>

<h2 title="3. LORD TREVLYN’S HEIR">CHAPTER THE THIRD.<br />

<small>LORD TREVLYN’S HEIR</small></h2></div>


<p>Lord Trevlyn sat in his study in the
slowly waning daylight, waiting the
arrival of his expected guest. Now that
the moment had come, he shrank from
the meeting a good deal more than he
had once believed he should do. It
was so long since he had seen a
strange face, and his relations with
this unknown heir would perhaps be
difficult: undoubtedly the situation was
somewhat strained. Would the young
man think a trap was being set for him in
the person of the beautiful Monica? Was
he acting a wise or fatherly part in schem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>ing
to give her to this stranger, if it should
be possible to do so?</p>

<p>He had liked the tone of Randolph
Trevlyn’s courteously-worded acceptance
of his invitation. He had liked all that
he heard of the man himself. He
had a sort of presentiment that his wish
would in time be realised, that this visit
would not be fruitless; but his child’s
happiness: would that be secured in
securing to her the possession of a well-loved
home?</p>

<p>Randolph Trevlyn would hardly be
likely to spend any great part of his
life at this lonely sea-bound castle. He
might pass a few months there, perhaps;
but where would the bulk of his time be
spent?</p>

<p>Lord Trevlyn tried to picture his beau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>tiful,
wayward, freedom-loving daughter
mixing in the giddy whirl of London life,
learning its ways and following its fashions,
and he utterly failed to do so. She
seemed indissolubly connected with the
wild sea-coast, with the gloomy pine-woods,
with the rugged independence of her sea-girt
home. Monica a fashionable young
countess, leading a gay life of social distraction!
The thing seemed impossible.</p>

<p>But he had no time to indulge his
imaginings farther. The door opened, and
his guest was ushered in. The old earl
rose and bade him welcome with his customary
simple, stately courtesy. It was
growing somewhat dark in that oak-panelled
room, and for a minute or two
he hardly distinguished the features of
the stranger, but the voice and the words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>in which the young man answered his
greeting pleased his fastidious taste, and a
haunting dread of which he had scarcely
been fully aware faded from his mind at
once and for ever in the first moment of
introduction.</p>

<p>Lord Trevlyn heaved an unconscious
sigh of relief when he resumed his seat,
and was able to give a closer scrutiny to
his guest. One glance at his face, figure,
and dress, together with the pleasant sound
of his voice, convinced Lord Trevlyn that
this young man was a gentleman in the
rather restricted sense in which he employed
that elastic term.</p>

<p>He was a handsome, broad-shouldered,
powerful man, with a fine figure, dark
hair and moustache, dark blue eyes, frank
and well-opened, a quiet, commanding air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>and carriage, and that cast of countenance
which plainly showed that the blood of the
Trevlyns ran in his veins.</p>

<p>Lord Trevlyn eyed him with quiet
satisfaction, and from the conversation
that ensued he had no reason to rescind
his favourable impression. Randolph
Trevlyn was evidently a man of culture
and refinement, with a mental capacity
distinctly above the average. He was,
moreover, emphatically a man of the world
in its truest and widest sense—a man who
has lived in the world, and studied it
closely, learning thereby from its silent
teaching the good and the evil thereof.</p>

<p>The two men talked for a time of the
family to which they belonged, and the
deaths that had lately taken place, bringing
this young man so near to the title.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p>“The Trevlyns seem to be a dying
race,” said the old earl, half sadly. “Our
family is slowly dying out. I suppose it
has done its work in the world, and is not
needed any longer in these stirring times.
You and my daughter are now the sole
representatives of the Trevlyns in your
generation, as my sister and I are in ours.”</p>

<p>Randolph Trevlyn looked into his kinsman’s
face with a great deal of reverence
and admiration. He liked to meet a man
who was a genuine specimen of the “old
school.” He felt a natural reverence for
the head of his house, and his liking
showed itself in voice and manner. Lord
Trevlyn saw this, and was gratified, whilst
the younger man was pleased to feel himself
in accord with his host. The interview
ended with mutual satisfaction on both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>sides, and Randolph was taken up the
great oak staircase, down one or two dim,
ghostly corridors, and landed finally in a
couple of large panelled rooms, most
antiquely and quaintly furnished, in both
of which, however, great fires of pine logs
were blazing cheerily.</p>

<p>“We dine at eight,” Lord Trevlyn had
said, in parting with his guest. “I shall
hope then to have the pleasure of
introducing you to my sister and my
daughter.”</p>

<p>Left alone in his comfortable but rather
grim-looking quarters, Randolph broke
into a low laugh.</p>

<p>“And so this sombre old place, full of
ghosts and phantoms of departed days—this
enchanted castle between sea and forest—is
the home of the lovely girl I saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>yesterday! Incongruous, and yet so entirely
appropriate! She wants a setting
of her own, different from anything else.
It must have been Lady Monica I encountered,
the lady of the pine-wood. What
a sad, proud, lovely face it was, with its
frame of golden hair, and soft eyes like a
deer’s; and her voice was as sweet as her
face, low, and rich, and full of music.
What has been the secret of her life?
Some sorrow, I am certain, has overshadowed
it. Who will be the happy man
to bring the sunshine back to that lovely
troubled face? Randolph Trevlyn, do not
run on so fast. You are no longer a boy.
You must not judge by first impressions;
you will know more of her soon.”</p>

<p>Randolph’s encounter with Monica the
previous day had been purely accidental.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>The young man had reached <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maws one
day earlier than he had expected, one day
earlier than he had been invited to arrive
at the Castle. Some business in Plymouth
which he had expected would detain him
some days had been despatched with greater
speed than he had anticipated, and he had
gone on to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maws to renew acquaintance
with his old friend Pendrill, who lived, as
he remembered, in that place.</p>

<p>When he descended to the drawing room
it was to find the earl and Lady Diana
there before him, and he made as favourable
an impression upon the vivacious old
lady as he had done before upon her
brother. Yet he found his attention straying
sometimes from the animated talk of
his companion, and his eyes would wander
to the door by which Monica must enter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p>She came at last, stately, beautiful, statuesque,
her dress an antique cream-coloured
brocade, that had, without doubt, belonged
to some remote ancestress; her golden hair
coiled like a crown upon her graceful head.
She had that same indescribable air of isolation
and remoteness that had struck him
so much when he had seen her riding in
the wood. She did not lift her eyes when
her father presented the stranger to her,
but only bent her head very slightly, and
sat down by herself, somewhat apart.</p>

<p>But when dinner was announced, and
Randolph gave her his arm to lead her in,
she raised her eyes, and their glances met.
He saw that she recognised him, and yet
she gave not the slightest sign of having
done so, and her face settled into lines of
even more severe gravity than before. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>felt that she was annoyed at his having met
and addressed her previously, and that she
would brook no allusion to the encounter.</p>

<p>His talk with the Pendrills had prepared
him somewhat for Monica’s coldness
towards himself. It was natural enough,
he thought, and perhaps a little interesting,
especially as he meant to set himself to win
her good-will at last.</p>

<p>He did not make much way during
dinner. Monica was very silent, and Lady
Diana engrossed almost all his attention;
but he was content to bide his time,
conscious of the charm of her presence,
and of the haunting, pathetic character of
her beauty, and deeply touched by the
story of her devotion to the crippled,
suffering Arthur, which was told him by
the earl when they were alone together,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>with more of detail than he had heard it
before.</p>

<p>When he returned to the drawing-room,
he went straight up to Monica, and said:</p>

<p>“I am going to ask a favour of you,
Lady Monica. I want to know if you will
be good enough to introduce me to your
brother?”</p>

<p>Her face softened slightly as she raised
her eyes to his. It was a happy instinct
that had led Randolph to call Arthur by
the name she most loved to hear, “your
brother.”</p>

<p>“You would like to see him to-night?”</p>

<p>“If it is not too late to intrude upon an
invalid, I should very much.”</p>

<p>“I think he would be pleased,” said
Monica. “It is so seldom he has any one
to talk to.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<p>The visit to Arthur was a great success.
The lad took to Randolph at once, delighted
to find him so young, so pleasant,
and so companionable. Of course he
identified him at once as the hero of
Monica’s adventure yesterday, and was
amused to hear his account of the meeting.
Monica did not stay long in the room; but
her absence enabled Arthur to sing her
praises as he loved to do, and Randolph
listened with a satisfaction that surprised
himself. He was very kind to the boy,
sincerely sorry for his helpless state, and
more than ready to stand his friend if ever
there should be occasion. Before he left
the invalid that night, he felt that in him,
at least, he had secured a staunch and
trusty friend.</p>

<p>But during the days that followed he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>could not hide from himself the fact that
Monica avoided him. Indeed, he sometimes
hardly saw her from morning till night, and
when they did meet at the luncheon or
dinner-table, she sat still and silent, scarcely
vouchsafing him a word or a look.</p>

<p>The first time Randolph found himself
alone with Monica was in this wise: he
had been riding about the immediate precincts
of the Castle with the earl one
morning, and his host was just expressing a
wish to extend their ride farther, in order
to see some of the best views of the neighbourhood—hesitating
somewhat on his own
account, as he had been forbidden to exert
himself by much exercise—when Monica
suddenly appeared, mounted on Guy, and
attended by her convoy of dogs, ready for
her daily gallop.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>Lord Trevlyn’s face softened at her
approach; he loved his fair daughter with
a deep and tender love.</p>

<p>“Monica, my dear, you have come in
good time. I want Mr. Trevlyn to see the
view of the Castle from the Black Cliff, and
the wonderful archway in the rocks farther
along the coast. These fine days must not
be wasted; and I feel too tired to undertake
the ride myself. Will you act as my
substitute, and do the honours of
Trevlyn?”</p>

<p>Monica glanced with a sort of mute
wistfulness into her father’s pale face, and
assented quietly. The next moment she
and Randolph were riding side by side
over the close soft turf of the sweeping
downs.</p>

<p>The girl’s face was set and grave, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>seemed lost in thought, and was only
roused by the eccentricities of Guy’s
behaviour. The spirited little barb resented
company even more than his
mistress did, and showed his distaste by
every means in his power. He was so
troublesome that Randolph was half afraid
for Monica’s safety, but she smiled at the
idea of danger.</p>

<p>“I know Guy too well,” she answered;
“it is nothing. He only hates company. He
is not used to it.”</p>

<p>“Had you not better have another horse
to-day?”</p>

<p>“Let myself be conquered? No, thank
you. I always say that if that once were
to happen, it would never be safe ever for
me to ride Guy again.”</p>

<p>The battle with the horse brought the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>colour to her face and the light to her
eyes. She looked more approachable
now as she cantered along beside him
(victorious at last, with her dogs bounding
about her) than she had ever done before.
He drew her out a little about her four-footed
favourites, and being a lover of
animals himself, and knowing their ways,
they found a good deal to say without
trenching in any way upon dangerous or
personal topics.</p>

<p>They visited the places indicated by
Lord Trevlyn, and Randolph admired the
beauties of the wild coast with a genuine
appreciation that satisfied Monica. Had
her companion been anybody but himself—an
alien usurper come to spy out the
land that would some time be his own—had
his praises been less sounded in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>ears by Lady Diana, whose praise was in
Monica’s eyes worse than any open condemnation—she
could almost have found it in
her heart to like him; but as it was,
jealous distrust drove all kindlier feelings
away, and even his handsome person and
pleasant address added to her sense of hostility
and disfavour.</p>

<p>Why was he to win all hearts—he who
would so ruthlessly act the part of tyrant
and foe, as soon as his chance came? Did
not even his friend, Lady Diana, continually
repeat that his succession to the
Trevlyn estate must inevitably mean an immediate
break-up of all existing forms and
usages? Was it not an understood thing
that he would exercise his power without
considering anything but his strict legal
right? Lady Diana knew the world—that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>world to which Randolph evidently belonged.
If this was her opinion, was it not
presumably the right one? She sneered
openly at the suggestion her niece had once
thrown out of the possibility of his granting
to Arthur liberty to remain at Trevlyn.</p>

<p>“You foolish child!” she said sharply.
“What is Arthur to him? Men do not
make sentimental attachments to each
other. Arthur has no right here, and Mr.
Trevlyn will show him so very plainly
when the time comes.”</p>

<p>Was it any wonder that Monica’s heart
rose in revolt against this handsome,
powerful stranger, who seemed in a
manner to hold her whole future in his
strong hands? Was it strange she avoided
him? Was it difficult to understand that
she distrusted him, and that only his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>present kindness to Arthur and the lad’s
affection for him enabled her to tolerate
with any kind of submission his presence
in the house?</p>

<p>He tried now to make her talk of herself,
of Arthur, of her home and her life there,
but she became at once impenetrably silent.
Her face assumed its old look of statuesque
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hauteur</i>. The ride back to the Castle was
a very silent one. Randolph had enjoyed the
hour he had spent in the company of Lady
Monica, but he could not flatter himself
that much ground had been gained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">

<small>CONRAD FITZGERALD.</small></h2></div>


<p>Whether Monica would ever have thawed
towards him of her own free will Randolph
Trevlyn could not tell; but during a sharp
attack of illness that prostrated Arthur at
this juncture, he was so much in the sick
boy’s room, and so kind and patient and
helpful there, that the girl’s coldness began
insensibly to melt; and before the attack
had passed, he felt that if she did not share
her brother’s liking for him, at least the old
antipathy, hostility, had somewhat abated.</p>

<p>They rode out together sometimes now,
exploring the country round the Castle, or
galloping over the wind-swept moors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>Monica was generally silent, always
reserved and unapproachable, and yet he
felt that a certain vantage-ground had been
gained, and he did not intend to allow it to
slip away. Unconsciously almost to himself,
the wish had grown to win the heart
of this wild, beautiful, lonely young
creature. Yet the charm of her solitary
tamelessness was so great that he hardly
wished the spell to be too suddenly broken.
He could not picture Monica other than
she was—and yet he was growing to love
her with every fibre of his being.</p>

<p>But fortune was not kind to Randolph,
as an incident that quickly followed showed
him.</p>

<p>He and Monica had ridden one day
across a wild sweep of trackless moorland,
when they came in sight of a picturesque
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>Elizabethan house, in a decidedly dilapidated
condition, whose red brick walls and
mullioned windows took Randolph’s fancy.
He asked who lived there.</p>

<p>“No one now,” answered Monica, with
a touch as of regret in her voice; “no one
has lived there for years and years. Once
it was such a bright, happy home—we used
to play there so often, Arthur and I, when
we were children; but the master died, the
children were taken away, and the house
was shut up. That was ten years ago. I
have never been there since.”</p>

<p>“Who is the owner? Does he never
reside here now?”</p>

<p>“He has never been back. I believe he
is not rich, and could not keep up the
place. He must be about five-and-twenty
by this time. He is Sir Conrad Fitzgerald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>—he
was such a nice boy when I used to
play with him.”</p>

<p>Randolph started suddenly; he controlled
himself in a moment, but Monica’s
eyes were very quick, and she had seen the
instinctive recoil at the sound of the
name.</p>

<p>“Do you know Conrad Fitzgerald?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“We have met,” he answered, somewhat
grimly. “I do not claim the honour of his
acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Monica glanced at him. She saw something
in the stern lines of Randolph’s face
that told a tale of its own. She was not
afraid to state the conclusion she reached
by looking at him.</p>

<p>“That means that you have quarrelled,”
she said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>
<p>“I am not at liberty to explain what it
means,” was the answer, spoken with a
certain stern gravity, not lost upon Monica.
She had never seen her companion look
like this before. The strength and resolution
of his face compelled a sort of involuntary
respect, yet she revolted against
hearing the friend and playmate of her
childhood tacitly condemned by this
stranger.</p>

<p>“I do not like innuendoes, Mr. Trevlyn,”
she said. “If you have anything to say
against a man I think it is better spoken
out.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing at all to say upon the
subject of Sir Conrad Fitzgerald,” he
answered, quietly.</p>

<p>“Ungenerous! unmanly!” was Monica’s
mental comment. “I cannot bear hearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>a character <em>hinted</em> away. I loved Conrad
once, and he loved me. I do not believe
he has done anything for which he should
be condemned.”</p>

<p>Randolph thought little of the few
chance words respecting Sir Conrad Fitzgerald
at the time when they were spoken;
but he was destined to think a good deal
about that individual before many days
had passed.</p>

<p>Finding his way to Arthur’s room
towards dusk one day, as he often did, he
was surprised to find quite a little group
around the glowing fire. Monica and the
dogs were objects sufficiently familiar to
him by this time, but who was that
graceful, fair-haired youth who sat beside
the girl, his face turned towards her and
away from Randolph, whilst he made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>some gay, laughing rejoinder to her in a
very sweet, musical voice?</p>

<p>Randolph recognised that laugh and that
voice with another start of dismay. His
face set itself in very stern lines, and he
would have withdrawn in silence had he
been able to do so unobserved; but Arthur
saw him as he moved to go, and cried
gladly:</p>

<p>“Oh, here is Randolph—that is right.
Our old friend and our new one must be
introduced. Sir Conrad Fitzgerald—Mr.
Randolph Trevlyn.”</p>

<p>Randolph’s eyes were fixed full upon the
face of the younger man as he made the
slightest possible inclination of the head.
His hand had unconsciously clenched itself
in a gesture that was a little significant.
Monica’s eyes were fixed upon Conrad.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>Was it possible that he quailed and flinched
a little beneath the steady gaze bent upon
him? She did not think so, she was sure
it could not be; no, he was only drawing
himself up to return that cold salutation
with one expressive of sovereign contempt.</p>

<p>Not a word was exchanged between the
two men. Randolph sat down beside
Arthur, and began to talk to him. Conrad
drew nearer to Monica, and entered into a
low-toned conversation with her. His
voice sounded tender and caressing, and
ever and anon such words as these reached
young Trevlyn’s ears:</p>

<p>“Do you remember, Monica?”—“Ah,
those sweet days of childhood!”—“You
have not forgotten?”—“How often have I
thought of it all.”</p>

<p>Evidently they were discussing the happy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>past—the bright days that had been shared
by them before the cloud had fallen upon
Monica’s life. Randolph could not keep
his eyes away from her face. It was lit
up with a new expression, half sad, and yet
strangely—infinitely sweet. Conrad’s face
was very beautiful too, with its delicate,
almost effeminate colouring and serious,
melancholy blue eyes. He had been a lovely
child, and his beauty had not faded with
time. It had stood him in good stead in
many crises of his life, and was doing so
still. There is an irrational association in
most minds between beauty and goodness.</p>

<p>But Randolph’s face grew more and
more dark as he watched the pair opposite.
Old memories were stirring within him,
and at last he rose and quitted the room,
feeling that he could no longer stand the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>presence of that man within it, could no
longer endure to see him bending over
Monica, and talking to her in that soft,
caressing way.</p>

<p>Conrad looked after him, a vindictive
light in his soft blue eyes. As the door
closed he uttered a low laugh.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Arthur.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing. I was only wondering
how long he would be able to brazen it
out?”</p>

<p>“Brazen what out?”</p>

<p>“Why, sitting there with my eye upon
him. Couldn’t you see how restless he
got?”</p>

<p>“Restless!” repeated Arthur, quickly.
“Why should he be restless?”</p>

<p>Conrad laughed again.</p>

<p>“Never mind, my boy. I bear him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>no malice. The least said the soonest
mended.”</p>

<p>Monica was silent and a little troubled.
She liked to understand things plainly.
It seemed to her an unnatural thing for
two men to be at almost open feud, yet
unwilling to say a word as to the cause of
their mutual antagonism. She thought
that if they met beneath her father’s
roof they should be willing to do so as
friends.</p>

<p>Her gravity did not escape Conrad’s
notice.</p>

<p>“Has he been maligning me already?”
he asked, suddenly, with a subdued flash in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“No,” answered Monica, with a sort of
involuntary coldness. “He has not said
a word. I do not think,” she added
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>presently, with a gentle dignity of manner,
“that I should listen very readily from
the lips of a stranger to stories detrimental
to an old companion and playmate, told
behind his back.”</p>

<p>Conrad gave her a look of humble
gratitude. He would have taken her hand
and kissed it had she been anybody else,
but somehow, demonstrations of such a
kind always seemed impossible where
Monica was concerned. Even to him she
was decidedly unapproachable.</p>

<p>“It is good indeed of you to say so,” he
said; “but, Monica—I may call you
Monica still, may I not? as I have always
thought of you all these long years—you
might hear stories to my detriment that
would not be untrue. There have been
faults and follies and sins in my past life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>that I would gladly blot out if I could. I
have been wild and reckless often. I lost
my parents very young, as you know, and
it is hard for a boy without home and
home influences to grow up as he should
do.” Conrad paused, and then added,
with a good deal of feeling: “Monica,
can a man do more than repent the past?
Can nothing ever wipe away the stain, and
give him back his innocence again?
Must he always bear about the shadow of
sorrow and shame?”</p>

<p>Monica’s face was grave and thoughtful.
She shook her head as she
replied:</p>

<p>“It is no use coming to me with hard
questions, Conrad; I know so little, so very
little of the world you live in. Yet it
seems to me that it would be hard indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>if repentance did not bring forgiveness in
its wake.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“‘Who with repentance is not satisfied,</div>
      <div class="verse">Is not of heaven nor of earth.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>quoted Arthur, lazily. “What is it you
have done? Can’t you tell us all the
story, and let us judge for ourselves—old
friends and playmates as we are?”</p>

<p>“I should like to,” answered Conrad,
gently. “Some day I will; but do not
let us spoil this first meeting with bitter
memories. Let it be enough for me to
have come home, and have found my
friends unchanged towards me. May I
venture still to call you my friends?”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” cried Arthur, readily;
but Conrad’s eyes were fixed on Monica’s
face; and she saw it, and looked back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>at him with her steady, inscrutable
gaze.</p>

<p>“I do not think I change easily,” she
said, with her gentle dignity of manner.
“You were my friend and playmate in our
happy childhood. I should like to think
of you always as a friend.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” put in Arthur, gaily; “of
course we are all friends, and you must
make friends with Randolph, too. He is
such a good fellow.”</p>

<p>“I have no objection at all,” answered
Conrad, with a short laugh. “The
difficulty, I imagine, will be on his side.
Some men never forget or forgive any one
who succeeds in finding them out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we will manage Randolph, never
fear. You are ready, then, to make it up
if he is?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p>“Most certainly,” was the ready answer.</p>

<p>“He is the nobler man of the two,” said
Monica to herself—at least her reason and
judgment said so; her instinct, oddly
enough, spoke in exactly opposite words;
but surely it was right to listen first to the
voice of reason.</p>

<p>“I say, Randolph,” said Arthur, half an
hour later, when the young baronet had
taken his departure and the other guest
had returned to the invalid’s room.
“Conrad is quite willing to make it up
with you.”</p>

<p>Randolph’s smile was a little peculiar.</p>

<p>“Sir Conrad Fitzgerald is very kind.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know, it’s always best to
make friends, isn’t it? Deadly feuds
are a nuisance in these days, don’t you
think so?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>Randolph smiled again; but his manner
was certainly a little baffling.</p>

<p>“Come now, Randolph,” persisted Arthur,
with boyish insistence, “you won’t hang
back now that he is ready for the reconciliation.
He is the injured party, is he
not?”</p>

<p>There was rather a strange light in Randolph’s
dark blue eyes. His manner was
exceedingly quiet, yet he looked as if he
could be a little dangerous.</p>

<p>“Possibly,” was the rather inconclusive
answer.</p>

<p>“You know he has come to stay some
little time in the neighbourhood, and he
will often be here. It will be so awkward
if you are at daggers drawn all the
time.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, you need not put your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>self
about. I will take care that there
shall be no annoyance to anybody.”</p>

<p>“You will make friends, then?”</p>

<p>“I will meet Sir Conrad Fitzgerald,
whenever he is your father’s guest, with
the courtesy due from one man to another,
when circumstances bring them together
beneath the roof of the same hospitable
host. But to take his hand in reconciliation
or friendship is a thing that I cannot
and will not do. Do you understand
now?”</p>

<p>Arthur looked at him intently, as for
once Monica was doing also.</p>

<p>“Randolph,” he said, a little inconsequently,
“do you know I think I could
almost be afraid of you sometimes. I
never saw you look before as you looked
just then.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>The stern lines on Randolph’s face
relaxed a little but he still looked grave
and pre-occupied, sitting with his elbow on
his knee, leaning forward, and pulling his
moustache with an abstracted air.</p>

<p>“You are rather unforgiving too, I
think,” pursued the boy. “Conrad admitted
he had done wrong, but he is very sorry
for the past; and I think it is hard when
old offences, repented of, are not consigned
to oblivion.”</p>

<p>Randolph was silent.</p>

<p>“Don’t you agree?”</p>

<p>Still only impenetrable silence.</p>

<p>“Come, Randolph, don’t be so mysterious
and so revengeful. Let us have the
whole story, and judge for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Arthur; but the life of Sir
Conrad Fitzgerald is not one that I choose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>to discuss. His affairs are no concern of
mine, nor, if you will pardon my saying
so, any concern of yours, either. You
are at liberty to renew past friendship with
him if it pleases you to do so; but it is
useless to ask me to do the same.”</p>

<p>And with that Randolph rose, and
quitted the room without another word.</p>

<p>“There is something odd about it all,”
said Arthur, who was inclined to indulge
a good deal of curiosity about other
people’s affairs: “but I think Conrad
behaves the better of the two.”</p>

<p>Monica quietly assented; but perhaps
she might have changed her opinion had
she heard the muttered threats breathed by
Conrad as he rode across the darkening
moor:</p>

<p>“So, Randolph Trevlyn, our paths have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>crossed once more! I have vowed vengeance
upon you to your very face, and
perhaps my day has come at last. I see
through you. I see the game you are
playing. I will baulk you, if I can; but
in any case I will have my revenge.”</p>

<h2 title="5. SUNDAY AT TREVLYN">CHAPTER THE FIFTH.<br />

<small>SUNDAY AT TREVLYN.</small></h2></div>


<p>It was Sunday, and Monica, with Randolph
beside her, was making her way by the path
along the cliff towards the little old church
perched high upon the crags, between
Trevlyn and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Maws, but nearer to the
town than the Castle. Randolph had found
out the ways of the house by this time.
He knew now that Monica played the
organ in the little church, that she started
early and walked across the downs, instead
of going in the carriage with her father
and aunt. He knew that she generally
lunched with the Pendrills between services,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>and that one of her cousins walked back
with her to the Castle, and spent an hour
with Arthur afterwards.</p>

<p>He had found out all this during his first
two Sundays, and upon the third he had
ventured to ask permission to be her
escort.</p>

<p>Randolph was quite aware that he had
lost ground with Monica of late; that the
barrier, partially broken down during the
week of anxiety about Arthur, had risen up
again as impenetrably as ever. How far
Sir Conrad Fitzgerald’s appearance upon
the scene was to blame for this he could
not tell, nor could Monica herself have
explained; but there was no mistaking the
added coldness on her part, and the
sense of restraint experienced in his
presence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>And yet he was conscious that his love
for her increased every day, and that no
coldness on her part checked or dwarfed
its growth. He sometimes wondered at
himself for the depth and intensity of his
passion, for he was a man who had passed
almost unscathed heretofore from the
shafts of the blind god, nor was he by
nature impulsive or susceptible. But then
Monica was like no woman he had ever
met before, and from the very first she had
exercised a curious fascination over him.
Also their relative positions were peculiar;
she the daughter and he the heir of the old
earl, whose life was evidently so very frail.
Randolph had a shrewd idea that his
kinsman had little to leave apart from the
entail, and in the event of his death what
would become of the fair girl his daughter?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>Would it be her fate to be placed in the
keeping of that worldly spinster, the Lady
Diana? Randolph’s whole soul revolted
from such an idea.</p>

<p>So, altogether, his interest in Monica
was hardly more than natural, and his sense
of protecting championship not entirely
uncalled for. One thing he had resolutely
determined upon—that she should never
suffer directly or indirectly on his account.
He had made no definite plans as regarded
the future, but on that point his mind was
made up.</p>

<p>To-day, for the first time, he ventured to
allude to a subject hitherto never touched
upon between them.</p>

<p>“You have a very beautiful home, Lady
Monica,” he said. “It is no wonder that
you love it.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>Her glance met his for a moment, and
then her eyes dropped again.</p>

<p>“Is it true that you have never left
Trevlyn all your life?”</p>

<p>“Except for a few days with Arthur,
never.”</p>

<p>“You have never seen London?”</p>

<p>“No, never,” very emphatically.</p>

<p>“Nor wish to do so?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>He mused a little. Somehow it was more
difficult than he had believed to convey
to her the information he had desired
to hint at. He entered upon another
topic.</p>

<p>“Have you ever been advised, Lady
Monica, to try what the German baths
could do for Arthur? Very wonderful
cures sometimes are accomplished there.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>She raised her head suddenly, with
something of a flash in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Tom Pendrill has been talking to
you!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, no.”</p>

<p>“That is what he wants—what he is
always driving at. He does not care how
my poor boy suffers, if only he has the
pleasure of experimenting upon him for the
benefit of science. I will not have it. It
would kill him, it would kill me. You do
not know how he suffers in being moved;
a journey like that would be murder.
He can live nowhere but at Trevlyn—Trevlyn
or the neighbourhood, at least.
Promise me never to suggest such a thing,
never to take sides against me in it. Mr.
Trevlyn, I appeal to your honour and your
humanity. Promise me never to league
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>with Tom Pendrill to send Arthur away to
die!”</p>

<p>He had never seen her so vehement or
excited. He was astonished at the storm
he had aroused.</p>

<p>“Indeed, Lady Monica, you may trust
me,” he said. “I have not the least wish
to distress you, or to urge anything in
opposition to your wishes. The idea
merely occurred to me, because I happen to
have heard of many wonderful cures. But
I will never allude to the subject again if
it distresses you. It is certainly not for
me to dictate to you as to the welfare of
your brother.”</p>

<p>The flush of excitement had faded from
Monica’s face. She turned it towards him
with something of apology and appeal.</p>

<p>“Forgive me if I spoke too hastily,” she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>said, with a little quiver in her voice
which he thought infinitely pathetic, “but
I have so few to love, and the thought of
losing them is so very sad. And then
Tom has so often frightened me about
Arthur and taking him away; and I know
that I understand him better than anybody
else, though I am not a doctor, nor a man
of science.”</p>

<p>He looked at her with grave sympathy.</p>

<p>“I think that is highly possible, Lady
Monica. You may trust me to say or do
nothing that could give you anxiety or
pain.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered Monica with
unusual gentleness. “I do trust you.”</p>

<p>His heart thrilled with gladness at those
simple words. They had almost reached
the church now, and Monica paused at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>the edge of the cliff, turning her gaze
seawards, a strange, sad wistfulness upon
her face.</p>

<p>Her companion watched her in silence.</p>

<p>“There will be a storm before long,” she
said at last.</p>

<p>The air was curiously clear and still, and
the sea the same; yet there was a sullen
booming sound far below that sounded
threatening and rather awful.</p>

<p>“You are weather-wise, Lady Monica?”
he asked with a smile.</p>

<p>“I ought to be,” she answered, turning
away at length with a long drawn breath.
“I know our sea so well, so very well.”</p>

<p>And then she walked on and entered the
church by her own little door, leaving
Randolph musing alone without.</p>

<p>He, too, lunched with the Pendrills that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>day. He had been over several times to
see them since his arrival at Trevlyn, and
had made his way in that house as
successfully as he had done at the Castle.</p>

<p>Tom walked with him to church for the
afternoon service. He spoke of Monica
with great frankness.</p>

<p>“I have always likened her to a sort
of Undine,” he remarked, “though not in
the generally accepted sense. There are
latent capacities within her that might
make her a very remarkable woman; but
half her nature is sleeping still. According
to the tradition, love must awake the
slumbering soul. I often think it is that
which wanted to transform and humanise
my Lady Monica.”</p>

<p>Randolph was silent. The smallest
suspicion of criticism of Monica jarred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>upon him. Tom saw this, and smiled to
himself.</p>

<p>They reached the little cliff church long
before the rustic congregation had begun
to assemble. The sound of the organ was
audible from within.</p>

<p>Tom laid his fingers on his lips and
made a sign to his companion to follow
him. They softly mounted a little quaint
stairway towards the organ loft, and
reached a spot where, hidden themselves
by the dark shadows, they could watch
the player as she sat before the instrument.</p>

<p>Monica had taken off her heavily-plumed
hat, and the golden sunshine glowed about
her fair head in a sort of mist of liquid
brightness. Her face wore a dreamy,
softened look, pathetically sad and sweet.
Her lustrous dark eyes were full of feeling.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>It seemed as if she were breathing out her
soul in the sweet, low strains of music that
sounded in the air.</p>

<p>Randolph gazed for one long minute,
and then silently withdrew; it seemed a
kind of sacrilege to take her unawares
like that, when she was unconscious of
their presence.</p>

<p>“Saint Cecilia!” he murmured softly,
as he descended the stairs once again.
“Monica, my Monica! will you ever be
mine in reality? Will you ever learn to
love me?”</p>

<p>Monica’s face still wore its softened
dreamy look as she joined Randolph at the
close of the service. Music exercised a
strange power over her, raising her for
a time above the level of the region
in which she moved at other times. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>looked pale and a little tired, as if the
strain of the week of anxiety about Arthur
had not yet quite passed off. As they
reached the top of the down and turned
the angle of the cliff, the wind, which had
been gradually rising all day and now blew
half a gale, struck them with all its force,
and Monica staggered a little beneath its
sudden fury.</p>

<p>“Take my arm, Lady Monica,” said
Randolph. “This is too much for you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she answered, gently;
and a sudden thrill ran through Randolph’s
frame as he felt the clinging
pressure of her hand upon his arm, and
was conscious that she was grateful for the
strong support against the fury of the
elements.</p>

<p>“It will be a dreadful night at sea,”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>said the girl presently, when a lull in the
wind made speech more easy. “Look at the
waves now? Are they not magnificent?”</p>

<p>The sea was looking very wild and
grand; Randolph halted a moment beneath
the shelter of a projecting crag, and gazed
at the tempest-tossed ocean beneath.</p>

<p>“You like a storm at sea, Lady
Monica?”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a sort of horror
in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Like a storm!”</p>

<p>“You were admiring the grandeur of the
sea just now.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you do not understand!” she said,
and gazed out before her, a far-away look
in her eyes. Presently she spoke again,
looking at him for a moment with a world
of sadness in her eyes, and then away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>over the tossing sea. “It is all very grand,
very beautiful, very wonderful; but oh, so
cruel, so pitiless in its strength and beauty!
Think of the sailors, the fishermen out on
the sea on a night like this, and the wives
and mothers and little children, waiting at
home for those who, perhaps, will never
come back again. You do not understand.
You belong to another world. You are
not one of us. I have been down amongst
them on wild, stormy nights. I have
paced the beach with weeping women,
watching, waiting for the boats that never
came back, or came only to be dashed in
pieces against the cruel rocks before our
very eyes.” She paused a moment, and he
felt her shudder in every limb; but her
voice was still low and quiet, just vibrating
with the depth of her feelings, but very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>calm and even. “I have seen boats go
down within sight of home, within sound
of our voices, almost within reach of our
outstretched hands—almost, but not quite;
and I have seen brave men, men I have
known from childhood, swept away to
their death, whilst we—their wives, their
mothers, and I—have stood at the water’s
edge, powerless to succour them. Ah, you
do not, you cannot understand! I have
seen all that, and more—and you ask me
if I like a storm at sea!”</p>

<p>She stood very still for a few seconds,
and then took his arm again.</p>

<p>“Let us go home,” she said, drooping a
little as the wind met them once more.
“I am so tired.”</p>

<p>He sheltered her all he could against
the fury of the gale, and presently they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>were able to seek the shelter of the pine
wood as they neared the Castle. Monica’s
face was very pale, and he looked at her
with a gentle concern that somehow in no
wise offended her.</p>

<p>“You are very tired,” he said, compassionately.
“The walk has been too
much for you.”</p>

<p>“Not the walk exactly,” answered
Monica, with a little falter in her voice; “it
was the music and the storm together, I
think. I am glad we sung the hymn for
those at sea to-night.”</p>

<p>He looked down at her earnestly.</p>

<p>“And yet the sea is your best friend,
Lady Monica. You have told me so yourself.”
She looked at him with strange,
wistful intensity.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is, it is,” she answered; “my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>best and earliest friend; and yet—and
yet——”</p>

<p>She paused, falling into a deep reverie;
he roused her by a question:</p>

<p>“Yet what, Lady Monica?”</p>

<p>Again that quick, strange glance.</p>

<p>“Do you believe in presentiments?”</p>

<p>“I am not sure that I do.”</p>

<p>“Ah! then you cannot be a true Trevlyn.
We Trevlyns have a strange forecasting
power. Coming events cast their shadow
over us, and we feel it—we feel it!”</p>

<p>He had never seen her in this mood
before. He was intensely interested.</p>

<p>“And you have a presentiment, Lady
Monica?”</p>

<p>She bent her head, but did not speak.</p>

<p>“And having said so much, will you
not say more, and tell me what it is?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<p>She stopped still, looked earnestly at
him for a moment, and then passed her
hand wearily across her face.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think,” she said, “that it
will be the great sea, my childhood’s friend,
that will bring to me the greatest sorrow
of my life; for is it not the emblem of
separation? Please take me in now. I
think a storm is very sad and terrible.”</p>

<p>He looked into her pale, sweet face, and
perhaps there was something in his glance
that touched her, for as they stood in the
hall at last she looked up with a shadowy
smile, and said:</p>

<p>“Thank you very much. You have been
very kind to me.”</p>

<p>That smile and those few simple words
were like a ray of sunlight in his path.</p>

<h2 title="6. IN PERIL">CHAPTER THE SIXTH.<br />

<small>IN PERIL.</small></h2></div>


<p>Perhaps there was some truth in what
Monica had said about her ability to
presage coming trouble. At least she
was haunted just now by a strange shadow
of approaching change that future events
justified only too well.</p>

<p>She often caught her father’s glance
resting upon her with a strange, searching
wistfulness, with something almost of
pleading and appeal in his face. She had
a suspicion that Arthur sometimes looked
at her almost in the same way, as if
he too would ask some favour of her,
could he but bring his mind to do so.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>She felt that she was watched by all the
household, that something was expected
of her, and was awaited with a sort
of subdued expectancy; but the nature
of this service she had not fathomed, and
greatly shrank from attempting to do so.
She told herself many times that she would
do anything for those she loved, that no
sacrifice would be too great which should
add to or secure their happiness; but she
did not fully understand what was expected
of her; only some instinct told her that it
was in some way connected with Randolph
Trevlyn.</p>

<p>Sir Conrad Fitzgerald came from time
to time to the Castle. He was cordially
received by the Earl and Lady Diana,
who had respected and liked his parents,
and remembered him well as a fair-haired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>boy, the childish playfellow and friend of
Monica and Arthur. Old feelings of intimacy
sprang up anew after the lapse of
time. It seemed as if he had hardly been
more than a year or two away. It was
difficult to realise that the young man was
practically an entire stranger, of whose
history they were absolutely ignorant.</p>

<p>Monica felt the change most by a certain
instinctive and involuntary shrinking from
Conrad that she could not in the least
explain or justify. She wished to like
him; she told herself that she did like
him, and yet she was aware that she never
felt at ease in his presence, and that he
inspired her with a certain indescribable
sense of repulsion, which, oddly enough,
was shared by her four-footed friends, the
dogs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>Monica had a theory of her own that
dogs brought up much in human society
became excellent judges of character, but if
so, she ought certainly to modify some of
her own opinions, for the dogs all adored
Randolph, and welcomed him effusively
whenever he appeared; but they shrank
back sullenly when Conrad attempted to
make advances, and no effort on his part
conquered their instinctive aversion.</p>

<p>Conrad himself observed this, and it
annoyed him. He greatly resented Randolph’s
protracted stay at the Castle, as he
detested above all things the necessity of
encountering him.</p>

<p>“How long is that fellow going to palm
himself upon your father’s hospitality?” he
asked Monica one day, with some appearance
of anger. He had encountered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>Randolph and the Earl in the park as he
came up, and he was aware that the cold
formality of the greeting which passed
between them had not been lost upon the
keen observation of the latter. “I call it
detestable taste hanging on here as he does.
When is he leaving?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. Father enjoys his
company, and so does Arthur. I have
not heard anything about his going yet.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you enjoy his company too?”
suggested Conrad, with a touch of insolence
in his manner.</p>

<p>A faint flush rose in Monica’s pale face.
Her look expressed a good deal of cool scorn.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I do,” she answered.</p>

<p>Conrad saw at once that he had made
a blunder. Face and voice alike changed,
and he said in his gentle, deprecating way:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>“Forgive me, Monica. I had no right
to speak as I did. It was rude and
unjustifiable. Only if you knew as much
as I do about that fellow, you would not
wonder that I hate to see him hanging
round you as he is doing now, waiting, as
it were, to step into the place that is his
by legal, but by no moral right. It would
be hard to see anyone acting such a part.
It is ten times harder when you know
your man.”</p>

<p>Monica looked straight at Conrad.</p>

<p>“What do you know against Mr.
Trevlyn? My father is acquainted with
all his past history, and can learn nothing
to his discredit. What story have you
got hold of? I would rather hear facts
than hints.”</p>

<p>Conrad laughed uneasily.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<p>“I know that he is a cad, and a sneak,
and a spy; but I have no wish to upset
your father’s confidence in him. We were
at Oxford together, and of course it was
not pleasant to me to hear his boasting of
his future lordship at Trevlyn. That was
the first thing that made me dislike him.
Later on I had fresh cause.”</p>

<p>Had Monica been more conversant with
the family history, she would have known
that this boasting could never have taken
place, as Randolph had been far enough
from the peerage at that time. As it was,
she looked grave and a little severe as
she asked:</p>

<p>“Did he do that?” and listened with
instinctive repugnance to the details
fabricated by the inventive genius of
Conrad.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>
<p>He next cleverly alluded again to his past
follies, and appealed to Monica’s generosity
not to change towards him because he had
sinned.</p>

<p>“It is so hard to feel cast off by old
friends,” he said, with a very expressive
look at the girl. “I know what it is to see
myself cold shouldered by those to whom
I have learned to look up with reverence
and affection. I have suffered very much
from misrepresentation and hardness—suffered
beyond what I deserve. I did
fall once—I was sorely tempted, and I did
commit one act of ingratitude and deceit
that I have most bitterly repented of. I
was very young and sorely tempted, and I
did something which might have placed
me in the felon’s dock, and would have
done so had somebody not far away had his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>will. But I was forgiven by the man I
had injured, and I have tried my utmost
since to make atonement for the past.
The hardest part of all has been to see
myself scorned and contemned by those
whose good-will I have most wished to
win. Sometimes I have known sorrow that
has been akin to despair. I have been
met with coldness and disdain when most I
needed help and sympathy. Monica, you
will not help to push me back into the
abyss? You will not help to make me
think that repentance is in vain?”</p>

<p>She looked at him very seriously, her
eyes full of a sort of thoughtful surprise.</p>

<p>“I, Conrad. What have I to do with it
or with you?”</p>

<p>“This much,” he answered, taking her
hand and looking straight into her eyes:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>“this much, Monica—that nothing so
helps a man who has fallen once as the
friendship of a noble woman like yourself;
nothing hurts him more than her ill-will or
distrust. Give me your friendship, and I
will make myself worthy of it; turn your
back coldly upon me, and I shall feel
doomed to despair.”</p>

<p>“We have been friends all our lives,
Conrad,” said Monica, with gentle seriousness.
“You know that if I could help
you in the way you mean I should like to
do so.”</p>

<p>“You will not change—you will not turn
your back upon me, whatever he may say
of me?”</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily, and answered,
“No.”</p>

<p>“You promise, Monica?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p>“There is no need for that, Conrad.
When I say a thing I mean it. We are
friends, and I do not change without
sufficient reason.”</p>

<p>He saw that he had said enough; he
raised her hand to his lips and kissed it
once with a humility and reverence that
could not offend her. Monica wandered
down by the lonely cliff path to the shore,
revolving many thoughts in her mind,
feeling strangely absorbed and abstracted.</p>

<p>The wind blew fresh and strong off the
sea. The tide rolled in fast, salt, and
strong. Monica felt that she wanted to be
alone to-day—alone with the great wild
ocean that she loved so well, even
whilst she feared it too in its fiercer
moods. She therefore made her way with
the agility and sure-footed steadiness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>long practice over a number of great
boulders, and along a jutting ledge of rock
that stretched a considerable distance out
to sea—a sunken reef that had brought to
destruction many a hapless fisherman’s
craft, and more than one stately vessel.</p>

<p>At high tide it was covered, but it would
not be high water for some hours yet, and
Monica, in her restless state of mental
tension, had forgotten that the high spring
tides were lashing the sea to fury just now
upon this iron-bound coast, rendered more
swift and strong and high by the steady
way in which the wind set towards the
land.</p>

<p>Standing on the great flat rock at the
end of the sunken reef, a rock that was
never covered even at the highest tides,
Monica was soon lost in so profound a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>reverie that time flew by unheeded; and
only when the giant waves began to throw
their spray about her feet as they dashed
up against the rock, did she suddenly rouse
up to the consciousness that for once in her
life she had forgotten herself, and forgotten
the uncertain temper of her tyrant playfellow,
and had allowed her retreat to be
cut off.</p>

<p>She looked round her quietly and
steadily, not frightened, but fully conscious
of her danger. The reef was already
covered; it would be impossible to retrace
her footsteps with the waves dashing wildly
over the sunken rocks. Monica was a
bold and practised swimmer, but to swim
ashore in a heavy sea such as was now
running was obviously out of the question.
To stand upon that lonely rock until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>tide fell again was a feat of strength and
endurance almost equally impossible. Her
best chance lay in being seen from the
shore and rescued. Someone might pass
that way, or even come in search of her.
Only the daylight was already failing, and
would soon be gone.</p>

<p>Monica looked round her, awed, yet
calm, understanding, without realising, the
deadly peril in which she stood. There
was always a boat—her little boat—lying
at anchor in the bay, ready for her use at
any moment. Her eyes turned towards it
instinctively, and as they did so she became
aware of something bobbing up and down
in the water—the head of a swimmer, as
she saw the next moment, swimming out
towards her boat.</p>

<p>Someone must have seen her, then, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>as all the fishing-smacks were out, and
there was no way of reaching the anchored
boat, save by swimming, had elected to
run some personal risk rather than waste
precious time in seeking aid farther afield.</p>

<p>A glow of gratitude towards her
courageous rescuer filled Monica’s heart,
and this did not diminish as she saw the
difficulty he had first in reaching the boat,
then in casting it loose, and last, but not
least, in guiding and pushing it towards an
uncovered rock and in getting in. But
this difficult and perilous office was accomplished
in safety at last, and the boat was
quickly rowed over the heaving, angry
waves to the spot where Monica stood
alone, amid the tossing waste of
water.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the tiny craft,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>and Monica experienced an odd sensation
of mingled surprise and dismay as she
recognised in her preserver none other than
Randolph Trevlyn.</p>

<p>But it was not a time in which speeches
could be made or thanks spoken. To bring
the boat up to the rock in the midst of the
rolling breakers was a task of no little
difficulty and danger, and had not Randolph
been experienced from boyhood in matters
pertaining to the sea, he could not possibly
have accomplished the feat unaided and
alone. There was no bungling on Monica’s
part, either. With steady nerve and quiet
courage she awaited the moment for the
downward spring. It was made at exactly
the right second; the boat swayed, but
righted itself immediately. Randolph had
the head round in a moment away from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>dangerous rock. In ten minutes they had
reached the shore and had landed upon the
beach.</p>

<p>Not a word had been spoken all that
time. Monica had given Randolph one
expressive glance as she took her seat in
the boat, and that is all that had so far
passed between them.</p>

<p>When, however, he gave her his hand
to help her to disembark, and they stood
together on the shingle, she said, very
seriously and gently:</p>

<p>“It was very kind of you to come out
to me, Mr. Trevlyn. I think I should have
been drowned but for you,” and she turned
her eyes seaward with a gaze that was
utterly inscrutable.</p>

<p>He looked at her a moment intently, and
then stooped and picked up his overcoat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>which lay beside his pilot jacket and boots,
upon the stones.</p>

<p>“Will you oblige me by putting this on
in place of your own wet jacket? You
are drenched with spray.”</p>

<p>She woke up from her reverie then, and
looked up quickly, doing as he asked
without a word; but when she had donned
the warm protecting garment, she said:</p>

<p>“You are drenched to the skin yourself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so a garment more or less is of no
consequence. Now walk on, please; do
not wait for me; I will be after you in
two minutes.”</p>

<p>Again she did his bidding in the same
dreamy way, and walked on towards the
ascent by the steep cliff path. He was not
long in following her, and they walked in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>almost unbroken silence to the Castle.
When they reached the portal, Monica
paused, and raised her eyes once more to
his face.</p>

<p>“You have saved my life to-day,” she
said. “I am—I think I am—very grateful
to you.”</p>

<p>Arthur’s excitement and delight when he
heard of the adventure were very great.</p>

<p>“So he saved you, Monica—at the risk
of his life? Ah, that just proves it!”</p>

<p>“Proves what?”</p>

<p>“Why, that he is in love with you, of
course, just as he ought to be, and will
marry you some day, make us all happy;
and keep us all at Trevlyn. What could
be more delightful and appropriate?”</p>

<p>A wave of colour swept over Monica’s
face.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<p>“You are a foolish boy, Arthur.”</p>

<p>“I am not a foolish boy!” he answered,
exultingly; “I know what I am saying.
Randolph <em>does</em> love you; I can see it more
plainly every day. He loves you with all
his heart, and some day soon he will ask
you to be his wife. Of course you will say
yes—you must like him, I am sure, as much
as every one else does; and then everything
will come right, and we shall all be
perfectly happy. Things always do come
right in the end, if we only will but
believe it.”</p>

<p>Monica sat very still, a strange, dream-like
feeling stealing over her. Arthur’s
playful words shed a sudden flood of light
upon much that had been dark before,
and for a moment she was blinded and
dazzled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<p>Randolph Trevlyn loved her! Yes, she
could well believe it, little as she knew of
love, thinking of the glance bent upon her
not long ago, which had thrilled her then,
she knew not why.</p>

<p>Monica trembled, yet she was dimly
conscious of a strange under-current of
startled joy beneath the troubled waters of
doubt, despondency, and perplexity. She
could not understand herself, nor read her
heart aright, yet it seemed as if through
the lifting of the clouds, she obtained a
rapid passing glimpse of a land of golden
sunshine beyond, whither her face and
footsteps alike were turned—as a traveller
amid the mountain mists sees before him
now and again the bright sunny smiling
valley beneath which he will shortly reach.</p>

<p>The land of promise was spreading itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>out already before Monica’s eyes, and a
dim perception in her heart was telling
her that this was so. Yet the sandy
desert path still lay before her for awhile,
for like many others, her eyes were
partially blinded, and she turned from the
direct way, and wandered still for awhile
in the arid waste. She lacked the faith to
grasp the promise; but it was shining
before her all the while, and in her heart
of hearts she felt it, though she could not
yet grasp the truth.</p>

<small>“WILT THOU HAVE THIS WOMAN?”</small></h2></div>


<p>Lord Trevlyn was not unobservant of the
feelings with which Randolph regarded
Monica. Quiet and self-contained as the
young man was, his admiration and the
pleasure he took in her society was still
sufficiently obvious, and his own opinions
were triumphantly endorsed by those of
Lady Diana.</p>

<p>“He is over head and ears in love with
her!” exclaimed that sharp-eyed dame to
her brother, about a couple of days after
Monica’s rescue by Randolph, of which,
however, she luckily knew nothing.
Indeed, the story of that adventure had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>only been told by the girl to Arthur and
her father, and both had had the tact and
discrimination not to broach the subject to
Lady Diana.</p>

<p>“He is over head and ears in love with
her, but she gives him not the smallest
encouragement, the haughty minx! and he
is modest, and keeps his feelings to himself.
It seems to me that the time has come
when you ought to speak out yourself,
Trevlyn; we cannot expect to keep a gay
young man like Randolph for ever in these
solitudes. Speak to him yourself, and see
if you cannot manage to bring about some
proper understanding.”</p>

<p>Lord Trevlyn had, in fact, some such idea
in his own mind. He and his young
kinsman were by this time upon easy and
intimate terms. They felt a mutual liking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>and respect, and had at times very nearly
approached the subject so near to the
hearts of both. That very night as they sat
together in the earl’s study, after the rest
of the household had retired, Lord Trevlyn
spoke to his guest with frankness and unreserve
of the thoughts that had for long
been stirring in his mind.</p>

<p>He spoke to his kinsman and heir of
his anxieties as to the future of his dearly-loved
and only child, who would at his
death be only very inadequately provided
for. He did not attempt to conceal the
hope he had cherished in asking Randolph
to be his guest, that some arrangement
might be made which should conduce
to her future happiness; and just as the
young man’s heart began to beat high
with the tumult of conflicting feelings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>within him, the old earl looked him steadily
in the face, and concluded with a certain
stately dignity that was exceedingly impressive.</p>

<p>“Randolph Trevlyn, I had heard much
in your favour before I saw you, so much,
indeed, that I ventured to entertain hopes
that may sound scheming and cold-blooded
when put into words, yet which do not, I
trust, proceed from motives altogether unworthy.
My daughter is very dear to me.
To see her happily settled in life, under
the protecting care of one who will truly
love and cherish her, has been the deepest
wish of my life. In our secluded existence
here there has been small chance of
realising this wish. I will not deny that in
asking you to be our guest it was with
hopes I need not farther specify. Some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>these hopes have been amply realised. I
will not seem to flatter, yet let me say that
in you I have found every quality I most
hoped to see in the man who is to be my
successor here. You are a true Trevlyn,
and I am deeply thankful it is so; and
besides this, I have lately entertained hopes
that another wish of mine is slowly fulfilling
itself. I have sometimes thought—let me
say it plainly—that you have learned to
love my daughter.”</p>

<p>“Lord Trevlyn,” said Randolph, with a
calmness of manner that betokened deep
feeling held resolutely under control, “I
do love your daughter. I think I have done
so ever since our first meeting. Every day
that passes only serves to deepen my love.
If I have your consent to try and win her
hand, I shall count myself a happy man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>indeed, although I fear her heart is not one
to be easily moved or won.”</p>

<p>Lord Trevlyn’s face expressed a keen
satisfaction and gladness. He held out
his hand to his young kinsman, and said
quietly:</p>

<p>“You have made a happy man of me,
Randolph Trevlyn. In your hands I can
place the future of my child with perfect
confidence. You love her, and you will
care for her, and make her life happy.”</p>

<p>Randolph wrung the proffered hand.</p>

<p>“Indeed you may trust me to do all in
my power. I love her with my whole heart.
I would lay down my life to serve her.”</p>

<p>“As you have demonstrated already,”
said the old earl, with a grave smile. “I
have not thanked you for saving my child’s
life. I hope in the future she will repay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>the debt by making your life happy, as you,
I am convinced, will make hers.”</p>

<p>Randolph’s bronzed cheek flushed a little
at these words.</p>

<p>“Lord Trevlyn,” he said, “to gain your
goodwill and assent in this matter is a
source of great satisfaction to me; but I
cannot blind my eyes to the fear that Lady
Monica herself, with whom the decision
must rest, has not so far given me any
encouragement to hope that she regards me
as anything beyond a mere acquaintance
and chance guest. I love her too well, I
think, not to be well aware of her feelings
towards me, and I cannot flatter myself for
a moment by the belief that these are
anything warmer than a sort of gentle
liking, little removed from indifference.”</p>

<p>The earl’s face was full of thought.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p>“Monica’s nature is peculiar,” he said;
“her feelings lie very deep, and are difficult
to read; no one can really know what they
may be.”</p>

<p>“I admit that; yet I confess I have
little hope—at least in the present.”</p>

<p>“Whilst I,” said Lord Trevlyn, quietly,
“have little fear.”</p>

<p>An eager look crossed Randolph’s face.</p>

<p>“You think——”</p>

<p>“I cannot easily explain what I think,
but I believe there will be less difficulty
with Monica than you anticipate. She
does not yet know her own heart—that I
admit. She may be startled at first, but
that is not necessarily against us. Will
you let me break this matter to her?
Will you let me act as your ambassador?
I understand Monica as you can hardly do.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>Will you let me see if I cannot plead your
cause as eloquently as you can do it for
yourself? Trust me it will be better so.
My daughter and I understand one another
well.”</p>

<p>Randolph was silent a moment, then he
said, very gravely and seriously:</p>

<p>“If you think that it will be best so, I
gladly place myself in your hands. I
confess I should find it difficult to approach
the subject myself—at any rate at present.
But”—he paused a moment, and looked
the other full in the face—“pardon me for
saying as much—you do not propose
putting any pressure upon your daughter?
Believe me, I would rather never see her
face again than feel that she accepted me
as a husband under any kind of compulsion
or restraint.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>Lord Trevlyn smiled a smile of approval.</p>

<p>“You need not fear,” he answered,
quietly. “Monica’s nature is not one to
submit tamely to any kind of coercion, nor
am I the man to attempt to constrain her
feelings upon a matter so important as this.”</p>

<p>“And if,” pursued Randolph, with quiet
resolution, “Lady Monica declines the
proposal made to her on my behalf, I shall
request you to join with me in breaking
the entail; for I can never consent to be
the means of taking from her that which
by every moral right is hers. I could not
for a moment tolerate the idea of wresting
from her the right to style herself, as she
has always been styled, the Lady of
Trevlyn. This is her rightful home, and I
shall appeal to you, if my suit fails, to
assist me in installing her there for life.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>
<p>The old earl looked much moved.</p>

<p>“This is very noble of you—most noble
and generous: but we will not talk of it
yet. I am not sure that I could bring
myself to help in separating the old title
from the old estate. You are very
generous to think of making the sacrifice;
whether I ought to permit you to do so is
another thing. At least let us wait and see
what our first negotiation brings forth.
Monica ought to know——” he paused,
smiled, and held out his hand. “Good-night.
I will speak to my daughter upon
the first opportunity. You shall have your
answer to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The next day Randolph spent at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Maws with Tom Pendrill. He felt that
whilst his fate hung in the balance it
would be impossible to remain at Trevlyn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>He rode across to his friend’s house quite
early in the day, and twilight had fallen
before he returned to the sombre precincts
of the Castle.</p>

<p>He made his way straight to the earl’s
study; the old man rose quickly upon his
entrance, and held out his hand. His face
beamed with an inward happiness and
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I wish you joy, Randolph,” he said,
wringing the young man’s hand. “We
may congratulate each other, I think.
Monica is yours—take her, with her
father’s blessing. It seems to me as if I
had nothing left to wish for now, save to
see you made my son, for such indeed you
are to me now.”</p>

<p>Randolph stood very still. He could
hardly believe his own ears. He had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>for a moment expected any definite answer,
save a definite refusal.</p>

<p>“Lady Monica consents to be my wife?”
he questioned. “Are you sure that this is
so?”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure. I had it from her
own lips.”</p>

<p>Randolph’s breath came rather fast.</p>

<p>“Does she love me?”</p>

<p>“Presumably she does. Monica would
never give her hand for the sake of rank
or wealth.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” he answered quickly, and
took one or two turns about the darkening
room. He was in a strange tumult of
conflicting feeling, and did not hear or
heed the low-spoken words addressed to
the servant, who had just entered with
fresh logs for the fire. His heart was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>beating wildly; he knew not what to think
or hope. He asked no more questions, not
knowing what to ask.</p>

<p>And then all at once he saw Monica
standing before him, standing with one
hand closely locked in that of her father,
looking gravely at him in the shadowy
twilight, with an inscrutable wistful sweetness
in her fathomless eyes.</p>

<p>“Randolph,” said Lord Trevlyn, “here
is your promised wife. I give her to you
with my blessing. May you both be as
happy as you have made me to-day by this
mutual act. Be very good to her, guard
her and shield her, and love her tenderly.
She is used to love and care from her
father; let me feel that in her husband’s
keeping she will gain and not lose by the
change in her future life. Monica, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>child, love your husband truly and faithfully.
He is worthy of you, and you are
worthy of him.”</p>

<p>Lord Trevlyn placed the hand he held
within Randolph’s grasp, and silently withdrew.</p>

<p>For a moment neither moved nor spoke.
The young man held the hand of his
promised wife between both of his, and
stood quite still, looking down with strange
intensity of feeling into the half-averted
face.</p>

<p>“Monica,” he said at last, “can this be
true?”</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes to his for a moment,
and then dropped them before his burning
glance.</p>

<p>“Monica,” he said again, “can it be
true that you love me?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>“I will be your wife if you will have
me,” she said, in a very clear, low tone.
“I will love you—if I can. I will try,
indeed. I think I can—some day.”</p>

<p>He was too passionately in love himself
at that moment to be chilled by this
response. It was more than he had ever
looked for, that sweet surrender of herself.
Protestations of love would sound strangely
from Monica’s lips. He hardly even wished
to hear them. She must feel some tenderness
towards him. She had given herself
to him to love and cherish; surely his
great love could accomplish the rest.</p>

<p>He drew her gently towards him. She
did not resist; she let herself be encircled
by his protecting arm.</p>

<p>“I will try to make you very happy,”
he said, with a sort of manly simplicity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>that meant more than the most ardent
protestations could have done. “May I
kiss you, Monica?”</p>

<p>She lifted her down-bent face a little, and
he pressed a kiss upon her brow. She
made no attempt to return the caress, but
he did not expect it. It was enough that
she permitted him to worship her.</p>

<p>“You have made me very happy,
Monica,” he said presently, whilst the
shadows deepened round them. “Will
you not let me hear you say that you are
happy too?”</p>

<p>She looked at him at last. He could
not read the meaning of that gaze.</p>

<p>“I want to make you happy, my
darling,” said Randolph, very softly.</p>

<p>Again that strange, earnest gaze.</p>

<p>“Make my father and Arthur happy,”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>she said, sweetly and steadily, “and I shall
be happy too.”</p>

<p>He did not understand the full drift of
those words, as he might perhaps have
done had he been calmer—did not realise
as at another moment he might have done
their deep significance. He was desperately,
passionately in love, carried away inwardly,
if not outwardly, by the tumult of his
feelings. He did not realise—it was hardly
likely that he should—that to secure her
father’s happiness and the future well-being
and happiness of her brother Monica had
promised to be his wife. She respected
him, she liked him, she was resolved to
make him a true and faithful wife; and
she knew so little of the true nature of
wedded love that it never occurred to her
to think of the injury she might be doing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>to him in giving the hand without the
heart.</p>

<p>She had been moved and disquieted by
Arthur’s words of a few days back. Her
father’s appeal to her that day had touched
her to the quick. What better could she
do with her life than secure with it the
happiness of those she loved? How better
could she keep her vow towards Arthur
than by making the promise asked of her?
Monica thought first of others in this
matter, it is true, and yet there was a
strange throb akin to joy deep down in her
heart, when she thought of the love
tendered to her by one she had learned to
esteem and to trust. Those sweet, sudden
glimpses of the golden land of sunshine
beyond kept flashing before her eyes, and
thrilled her with feelings that made her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>almost afraid. She did not know what it
all meant. She did not know that it was
but the foreshadowing of the deep love that
was rooting itself, all unknown, in the
tenderest fibres of her nature. She never
thought she loved Randolph Trevlyn, but
she was conscious of a strange exultation
and stress of feeling, which she attributed
to the enthusiasm of the sacrifice she had
made for those she loved. She did not yet
know the secret of her own heart.</p>

<p>So Monica had engaged herself to her
kinsman, Randolph Trevlyn, and the
neighbourhood, though decidedly astonished
at this sudden surrender of liberty
on the part of the fair, unapproachable
girl, could not but see how desirable was
the match from every point of view, and
rejoice in the thought that Trevlyn would
never lose its well-loved lady.</p>

<p>As for Monica herself, the days passed
by as in a dream—a strong dream of misty
sunshine and sweet, faint fragrance,
through which she wandered with un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>certain
steps, led onward by a sense of
brighter light beyond.</p>

<p>She was not unhappy; indeed, a strange
new sense of calm and rest had fallen upon
her since she had laid her hand in
Randolph’s and promised to love him if she
could. A few short weeks ago how she
would have chafed against the fetters she
wore! Now she hardly felt them as
fetters; they neither galled nor hurt her.
Indeed, after the feeling of uncertainty, of
impending change that had hung over her
of late, this peaceful calm was doubly
grateful. It seemed at last as if she had
reached the shelter of a safe haven, and
pausing there, with a sense of grateful well-being,
she felt as if no storm or tempest
could ever reach her again.</p>

<p>Monica’s nature was not introspective;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>she did not easily analyse her feelings.
Had she done so now, she might have laid
bare a secret deep down within her that
would have surprised her not a little; but
she never attempted to look into her heart,
she rather avoided definite thought; she
lived in a sort of vaguely sweet dream, glad
and thankful for the undercurrent of happiness
which had so unexpectedly crept into
her life. She did not seek to know its source—it
was enough that it was there.</p>

<p>Randolph was very good to her, she did
not attempt to deny that. Nothing could
have been more tender and chivalrous
than his manner towards her. He arrogated
none of the rights which an affianced
husband might fairly have claimed; he was
content with what she gave him; he never
tried to force her confidence or to win
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>words or promises that did not come
spontaneously to her lips.</p>

<p>She was shy with him for some time
after the engagement had been ratified,
more silent and reserved than she had been
before; yet there was a charm in her very
silence that went home to his heart, and
he felt that she was nearer to him day by
day.</p>

<p>“I will win her yet—heart and soul,”
he would say sometimes, with a thrill of
proud joy as he looked into the sweet eyes
raised to his, and read a something in their
depths that made his heart throb gladly.
“Give me time, only time, and she shall be
altogether mine.”</p>

<p>She never shunned him. She let him be
her companion when and where he would,
and she began to look for him, and to feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>more satisfied when he was at her side. He
was too wise to overdo her with his society,
or seem to infringe the liberty in which she
had grown up; but he frequently accompanied
her on her walks or rides, and he
had the satisfaction of feeling that his
presence was not distasteful to her; indeed,
as days went by, and she grew used to the
idea that had been at first so strange, he
fancied that there was something of
welcome in the smile that greeted his
approach.</p>

<p>She never spoke of the future when they
should be man and wife, and only by a hint
here and there did he broach the subject
or tell of his private affairs. Both were
content for the time being to live in the
present—that present that seemed so calm
and bright and full of promise.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>
<p>As days and weeks fled by, a colour
dawned upon Monica’s cheeks and a light
in her eyes; she grew more beautiful every
day or so, thought those who loved her, and
watched her with loving scrutiny; and Mrs.
Pendrill, who was, so to speak, the girl’s
good angel in this crisis of her life, would
caress the golden head sometimes, and ask
with gentle, motherly solicitude:</p>

<p>“My Monica is happy, is she not?”</p>

<p>“I think so, Aunt Elizabeth,” Monica
answered once, speaking out more freely
than she had done before. “Other people
are happy—the dread and uncertainty
about the future seems all gone. Trevlyn
is not sad any longer—it is my own home
again, my very own. I cannot quite
express it, but something seems to have
come into my life and changed everything.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>I am happy often now—nearly always, I
think.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pendrill smiled a little.</p>

<p>“Does your happiness result from the
knowledge that you—you and Arthur: I
suppose I must include him—need never
leave Trevlyn, and that you have pleased
your father? Tell me, Monica, is that
all?”</p>

<p>A faint colour mantled the girl’s face.</p>

<p>“I know it sounds selfish; but I hardly
think anyone knows what Trevlyn is to us,
and what Arthur’s welfare is to me.” Then
reading the meaning of the earnest glance
bent upon her, she added quickly, “Ah,
yes, Aunt Elizabeth, I know there is <em>that</em>
too. He is very, very good to me, and I
will do everything to make him happy, and
to be a good wife when the time comes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>Indeed, I do think of him. I know what
he is, and what he deserves—only—only I
cannot talk about that even to you.”</p>

<p>“I do not want you to talk, my love, I
only want you to feel.”</p>

<p>And very low the answer was spoken.</p>

<p>“I think I do feel.”</p>

<p>Certainly things were going well, very
well. It seemed as if the course of
Randolph’s true love might run smoothly
enough to the very end now. Tom Pendrill
chaffed him somewhat mercilessly on the
easy victory he had obtained over the
somewhat difficult subject, and he felt an
exultant sense of joyful triumph when he
compared his position of to-day with the
one he had occupied a week or two back.
Monica’s gentleness and growing dependence
upon him were inexpressibly sweet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>the dawn of a quiet happiness in her
face filled his heart with delight. The
victory was not quite won yet, but he
began to feel a confidence that it was not
far distant.</p>

<p>And this hope would in all probability
have been realised in due course, had it
not been for untoward circumstances, and
from the presence of enemies in the camp,
one his sworn foe, the other his champion
and ally: but despite this, a born mischief-maker
and mar-plot.</p>

<p>So long as Randolph was on the spot
all went well. His strong will dominated
all others, and his influence upon Monica
produced its own effect. Love like his
could not but win its way to the heart of
the woman he loved.</p>

<p>But Randolph could not remain always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>at Trevlyn. Hard as it was to tear himself
away, the conventionalities of life demanded
his absence from time to time, and
other duties called him elsewhere. And it
was when his back was fairly turned that
the mischief-makers began their task of
undoing, as far as was possible, all the
good that had been done.</p>

<p>Randolph had been exceedingly careful
to say nothing to Monica about hastening
their marriage. He saw that she took for
granted a long engagement, that she had
hardly contemplated as yet the inevitable
end whither that engagement tended; and
until he had assured himself that her
heart was wholly his, nothing would have
induced him to ask her to give herself
irrevocably to him. When the right
moment came she would surrender herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>willingly, for Monica was not one who
would do anything by halves. Till that
day came, however, he was resolved to
wait, and breathe no word of the future
that awaited them.</p>

<p>Lady Diana was of a different way of
thinking. She had been amazed at
Monica’s pliability in the matter of her
engagement, so surprised and so well
pleased that, for some considerable time,
she had acted with unusual discretion,
and had avoided saying anything to irritate
or alarm the sensitive feelings of her niece.
Possibly she stood in a little unconscious
awe of Randolph, for certainly so long as
he remained she was quiet and discreet
enough. But when his presence was once
removed, then began a system of petty persecution
and annoyance that was the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>thing to rouse in Monica a spirit of opposition
and hostility.</p>

<p>Lady Diana had set her heart upon a
speedy marriage, half afraid that her niece
might change her mind; she took a half
spiteful pleasure in the knowledge that the
girl’s independence was at last to be
curbed, and that she was about to take
upon herself the common lot of womanhood.
She lost no opportunities of reading
homilies on wifely submission and
subjection. She bestirred herself over the
matter of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trousseau</i> as if the day were
actually fixed, and Monica’s indignant
protests were laughed at and ignored as if
too childish for serious argument.</p>

<p>The girl began to observe, too, that her
father spoke of her marriage as of something
speedily approaching, and that he,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>Lady Diana, and even Arthur, seemed to
understand that she would spend much of
her time away from Trevlyn, when once
that ceremony had taken place. Her
father and brother spoke cheerfully of her
leaving them, taking it for granted that her
affianced husband was first in her thoughts,
and that they must make her way easy to
go away with him, without one regret for
those left behind. Lady Diana, with more
of feminine insight, had less of kindliness
in her method of approaching the subject;
but when she found them all agreed upon
the point, the girl felt almost as if she had
been betrayed. There was no Randolph to
shield and protect her. She could not put
into written words the tumult of her conflicting
feelings; she could only struggle and
suffer, and feel like a wild thing trapped in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>the hunter’s toils. Ah, if only Randolph
had not left her! But when the poison
had done its work, she ceased even to wish
for him back.</p>

<p>Another enemy to her peace of mind
was Conrad Fitzgerald. Monica was growing
to feel a great repugnance to this
fair-haired, smooth-tongued man, despite
the nominal friendship that existed between
him and those of her name. She
knew that her feelings were changing
towards him; but, like other young things,
she was ashamed of any such change,
regarding it as treacherous and ungenerous,
especially after the pledge she had given
him.</p>

<p>Conrad thus found opportunities of
seeing her from time to time, and set to
work with malicious pleasure to poison
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>her mind against her affianced husband.
She would not listen to a single direct word
against him: that he discovered almost at
once, somewhat to his astonishment and
chagrin; but “there are more ways of
killing a cat than by hanging it,” as he
said to himself; and a well-directed shaft
steeped in poison, and launched with a
practised hand, struck home and did its
work only too well.</p>

<p>He insinuated that after her marriage
Trevlyn would never be her home during
her father’s life-time, at least, possibly never
any more. Randolph had property of his
own; was it likely he would bury himself
and his beautiful young wife in a desolate
place like that? Of course her care of
Arthur would be a thing entirely put on
one side. It was out of the question that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>she should ever be allowed to devote
herself to him as of old, when once she
had placed her neck beneath the matrimonial
yoke. Most likely some excuse
would be forthcoming to rid Trevlyn of
the undesirable presence of the invalid.
Randolph was not a man to be deterred by
any nice scruples from going his own
way. Words spoken before marriage were
never regarded seriously when once the
inevitable step had been taken.</p>

<p>Monica heard, and partly believed—believed
enough to make her restless and
miserable. Never a word crossed her lips
that could show her trust in Randolph
shaken. She was loyal to him outwardly,
but she suffered keenly, nevertheless. He
was not there to give her confidence, as
he could well have done, by his unwaver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>ing
love and devotion, and in his absence,
the influence he had won slowly waned,
and the old fear and distrust crept back.</p>

<p>It might have vanished had he returned
to charm it away: but, alas! he only
came to make Monica his wife in sudden,
unexpected fashion, before her heart was
really won.</p>

<p>Lord Trevlyn had been taken dangerously
ill. It was an attack similar to those he
had suffered from once or twice before, but
in a more severe form. His life was in
imminent danger; nothing could save him,
the doctors agreed, but the most perfect
rest of body and mind; and it seemed as if
only the satisfaction of calling Randolph
son, of seeing him Monica’s husband, could
secure to him that repose of spirit so
absolutely essential to his recovery.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>
<p>Monica did not waver when her father
looked pleadingly into her face, and asked
if she were ready. Her assent was calmly
and firmly spoken, and after that she left
all in other hands, and did not quit her
father’s presence night or day.</p>

<p>He was better for the knowledge that
the wish of his heart was about to be
consummated, and she was so utterly
absorbed in him as to be all but unconscious
of the flight of time. She knew that
days sped by as on wings. She even
heard them speak of “to-morrow” without
any stirring of heart. She was absorbed
in care for her almost dying father; she
had no thought to spare for aught else.</p>

<p>On the evening of that day Randolph
stood before her, holding her hands in his
warm clasp.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>“Is this your wish, my Monica?”</p>

<p>She thrilled a little beneath his ardent
gaze, a momentary sense of comfort and
protection came over her in his presence;
but physical languour blunted her
feelings; she was too weary even to feel
acutely.</p>

<p>“It is my wish,” she answered gently.</p>

<p>He bent his head and kissed her tenderly
and lingeringly, looking earnestly into the
pale, sweet face that seemed not quite so
responsive as it had done when he saw
it last; but he could not read the look
it wore. He kissed her and went away,
breathing half sadly, half triumphantly, the
word “To-morrow.”</p>

<p>Lady Diana, ever indefatigable and contriving,
had managed as if by magic to
have all things in readiness; rich white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>satin and brocade, orange blossom and
lace veil—all was in readiness—as if she
had had weeks for her preparations.</p>

<p>Monica started and half recoiled as she
saw the bridal dress laid out for her adornment,
but she was quiet and passive in the
hands of her attendants as they arrayed
her in her snowy robes, and well she repaid
their efforts. Only Lady Diana felt any dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>“Why, child,” she said, impatiently,
“you look like a snow maiden. You might
be a nun about to take the veil instead of
a bride going to her wedding. I have no
patience with such pale looks. Randolph
will think we have brought him a corpse
for his bride.”</p>

<p>Randolph was waiting in the little
church on the cliff. His heart beat thick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>and fast; he himself began to feel as if he
were living in a dream. He could not
realise that the time had come when he
was to call Monica his own.</p>

<p>Lady Diana and Mrs. Pendrill were there,
and a friend of his own, young Lord
Haddon, who had accompanied him from
town the previous day, to play the part of
best man at the ceremony. There was a
little rustle and little stir outside, and then
Monica entered, leaning on Tom Pendrill’s
arm, and, without once lifting her eyes,
walked steadily up the church, till she stood
beside Randolph.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, had she looked more
lovely, yet never, perhaps, more remote
and unapproachable, than when she stood
before the altar in her bridal robes, to
pledge herself for better for worse to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>man who loved her, till death should them
part.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a strange pang
and aching at heart; but the moment was
not one when hesitation or drawing back
was possible.</p>

<p>In a few more minutes Monica and
Randolph Trevlyn were made man and
wife.</p>

<h2 title="9. MARRIED">CHAPTER THE NINTH.<br />

<small>MARRIED.</small></h2></div>


<p>“Married! Married! Married!”</p>

<p>The monstrous vibrating throb of the
express train seemed ceaselessly repeating
that one word. The sound of it was
beaten in upon Monica’s brain as with hot
hammers, and yet she did not feel as if
she understood what it meant, or realised
what happened to her. One thing only
was clear to her; that she had been torn
away from Trevlyn, from her father, who,
though pronounced convalescent, was still
in a very precarious state; from Arthur,
who after the anxiety and excitement of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>the past days, was prostrated by a sharp
attack of illness; from everything and
everybody she held most dear; and cast
as it were upon the mercy of a comparative
stranger, who did not seem the less strange
to her, because he had the right to call
himself her husband.</p>

<p>What had happened during the three
days that had passed since Monica had
stood beside Randolph in the little cliff
church, and had pledged herself to him
for better or worse?</p>

<p>She herself could not have said, but the
facts can be summed up in a few words.</p>

<p>When once Lord Trevlyn had seen
Monica led by Randolph to his bedside in
her bridal white, and knew that they were
man and wife, a change for the better had
taken place in his condition, very slight at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>first, but increasing every hour. Little by
little the danger passed away, and for the
time at least his life was safe.</p>

<p>But Monica’s mind, no sooner relieved
on his account, was thrown into fresh
misery and suspense by a bad attack of
illness on Arthur’s part, and the strain
upon her was so great, that, coming as it
did after all the mental conflict she had
lately endured, her own health threatened
to break down, and this caused no small
anxiety in the minds of all about her.</p>

<p>“There is only one thing to be done,
and that is to take her right away out of
it all,” said Tom Pendrill, with authority.
“She will break down as sure as fate if she
stays here. The associations of the place
are quite too much for her. She will have
a brain or nervous fever if she is not taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>away. You have a house in London,
Trevlyn? Take her there and keep her
quiet, but let her have change of scene;
let her see fresh faces, and get into new
habits, and see the world from a fresh
stand-point. It will do her all the good
in the world. She may rebel at first, and
think herself miserable; but look at her
now. What can be worse than the way in
which she is going on? Trevlyn is killing
her, whether she knows it or not. Let us
see what London can do for her.”</p>

<p>No dissentient voice was raised against
this suggestion. The earl, Lady Diana,
Randolph, and even Arthur, were all in
accord, and Monica heard her sentence
with that unnatural quietude that had
disturbed them all so much.</p>

<p>She did not protest or rebel, but accepted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>her fate very quietly, as she had accepted
the marriage that had been the preliminary
step.</p>

<p>How white she looked as she lay back
in her corner of the carriage! how lonely,
how frail, how desolate! Randolph’s
heart ached for her, for he knew her
thoughts were with her sick father and
suffering brother; knew that it, not
unnaturally, seemed very, very hard to be
taken away at a crisis such as the present.
She could not estimate the causes that
made a change so imperative for her. She
could not see why she was hurried away so
relentlessly. It had all been very hard
upon her, and upon him also, had he had
thought to spare for himself; but he was
too much absorbed in sorrow for her to
consider his own position over-much.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<p>He was indirectly the cause of her grief,
and his whole being was absorbed in the
longing to comfort her.</p>

<p>She looked so white and wan as the
hours passed by, that he grew alarmed
about her. He had done before all he
could to make her warm and comfortable,
and had then withdrawn a little, fancying
his close proximity distasteful to her, but
she looked so ill at last that he could keep
away no longer, and came over to her,
taking her hand in his.</p>

<p>“Monica,” he said gently.</p>

<p>The long lashes stirred a little and
slowly lifted themselves. The dark eyes
were dim and full of trouble. She looked
at him wonderingly for a moment, almost
as if she did not know him, and then she
closed her eyes with a little shuddering sigh.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>He was alarmed, and not without cause,
for the strain of the past days was showing
itself now, and want of rest and sleep had
worn down her strength to the lowest ebb.
She was so faint and weary that all power
of resistance had left her. She let her
husband do what he would, submitted
passively to be tended like a child, and
heaved a sigh that sounded almost like one
of relief as he drew her towards him, so
that her weary head could rest upon his
broad shoulder. There was something
restful and supporting, of which she was
dumbly conscious in the deep love and
protecting gentleness of this strong man.</p>

<p>She only spoke once to him, and that
was as they neared their destination, and
the lights of the great city began to flash
upon her bewildered gaze. Then she sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>up, though with an effort, and looking at
her husband, said gently:</p>

<p>“You have been very good to me,
Randolph.”</p>

<p>His heart bounded at the words, but he
only asked. “Are you better, Monica?”</p>

<p>She pressed her hand to her brow.</p>

<p>“My head aches so,” she said, and the
white strained look came back to her face.
She was almost frightened by the flashing
lights and the myriads of people she saw
as the train steamed into the terminus; and
she could only cling to Randolph’s arm in
hopeless bewilderment, as he piloted her
through the crowd to the carriage that was
awaiting them.</p>

<p>Randolph owned a house near to the
Park, in a pleasant open situation. It
had been left to him by an uncle, a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>traveller, and was quite a museum of
costly and interesting treasures, and fitted
up in the luxurious fashion that appeals to
men who have grown used to Oriental ease
and splendour.</p>

<p>The young man had often pictured
Monica in such surroundings, had wondered
what she would say to it all, how she
would feel in a place so strange and
unlike anything she had ever known. He
had fancied that the open situation of the
house would please her, that she might be
pleased too by the quaint beauty and
harmony of all she saw. He had often
pictured the moment when he should lead
her into her new home and bid her
welcome there, and now, when the time
had come, she was so worn out and ill
that her heavy eyes could hardly look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>around her, and all he could do was to
support her to her room, to be tended by
his old nurse, Wilberforce, whose services
he had bespoken for his wife in preference
to those of a more youthful and accomplished
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de chambre</i>.</p>

<p>For some days Monica was really ill,
not with any specific complaint, but
prostrated by nervous exhaustion—too
weary and exhausted to have a clear idea
of what went on around her, only conscious
that everything was very strange, that she
was far away from Trevlyn, and that
strangers were watching over and tending
her.</p>

<p>Her husband’s care was unremitting.
He was ever by her side. She seemed to
turn to him instinctively amid the other
strange faces, and to be more quiet and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>tranquil when he was near. Yet she
seldom spoke to him; he was not always
certain that she knew him; but that half
unconscious dependence was inexpressibly
sweet, and Randolph felt hope growing
stronger day by day. Surely she was
slowly learning to love him; and indeed
she was, only she knew it not as
yet.</p>

<p>Then a day came when the feverish
fancies and distressful exhaustion gave
way to more cheering symptoms. Monica
could leave her room, and leaning on her
husband’s arm, wander slowly about the
new home that looked so strange to her.
The smiles began to come back to her eyes,
a faint flush of colour to her cheeks, and
when at length she was laid down upon a
luxurious ottoman beside the drawing-room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>fire, she held her husband’s hand between
both of hers, and looked up at him with a
glance that went to his very heart.</p>

<p>“You have been so very, very good to
me, Randolph, though I have only been a
trouble to you all this time. I never
thought I could feel like this away from
Trevlyn. Indeed I will try to make you
happy too.”</p>

<p>He bent down and kissed her, a thrill of
intense joy running through him.</p>

<p>“Does that mean that you can be happy
here, my Monica?” he asked.</p>

<p>She was always perfectly truthful, and
paused a little before answering; yet there
was a light in her eyes and a little smile
upon her lips.</p>

<p>“It feels very strange,” she said, “and
very like a dream. Of course I miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>Trevlyn—of course I would rather be
there; but——” and here she lifted her
eyes with the sweetest glance of trusting
confidence. “I know that you know best,
Randolph, I know that you judge more
wisely than I can do; and that you
always think of my happiness first. You
have been very, very good to me all this
time, far better than I deserve. I am
going to be happy here, and when I may
go home, I know you will be the first to
take me there.”</p>

<p>He laid his hand upon her head in a
tender caress.</p>

<p>“I will, indeed, my Monica,” he
answered; “but, believe me, for the
present you are better here. You will
grow strong faster away from Trevlyn than
near it.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<p>She smiled a little, very sweetly.</p>

<p>“I will try to think so, too, Randolph,
for I am very sure that you are wiser than
I; and I have learned how good you are to
me—always.”</p>

<p>That evening passed very quietly, yet
very happily.</p>

<p>Was this the beginning of better things
to come?</p>

<small>MISCHIEF-MAKERS.</small></h2></div>


<p>“Now that you have been a fortnight in
town, and have begun to feel settled in
your new life,” wrote Lady Diana, “I think
it is time you should be made aware of a
few facts relative to your engagement and
marriage, which you are not likely to hear
from the lips of your too indulgent
husband, but with which, nevertheless, you
ought to be made conversant, in my
opinion, in order that you may the better
appreciate the generous sacrifices made on
behalf of you and your family, and return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>him the measure of gratitude he deserves
for the benefits he has bestowed.”</p>

<p>Monica was alone when she received this
letter, breakfasting in her little boudoir at
a late hour, for although almost recovered
now, she had not yet resumed her old habit
of early rising.</p>

<p>She had risen this morning feeling more
light at heart than usual. She had chatted
with unusual freedom to her husband, had
kissed him before he went out to keep an
appointment with his lawyer, and had
promised to ride with him at twelve
o’clock, if he would come back for her.
She had only once been out since her
arrival in town, and that was in the
carriage. She was quite excited at the
prospect of being in the saddle again.
She had almost told herself that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>should yet be happy in her married life—and
now came this cruel, cruel letter to dash
to the ground all her faint dawning hopes.</p>

<p>Lady Diana had felt very well-disposed,
even if a little spiteful, as she had penned
this unlucky letter; but she certainly was
not nice in her choice of words or of
epithets. Not being sensitive herself, she had
little comprehension of the susceptibilities
of others, and the impression its perusal
conveyed to the mind of Monica was that
Randolph had married her simply out of
generosity to herself and regard for her
father: that the proposal was none of his
own making, and that his unvarying kindness
arose from his knowledge of her very
difficult temper, and a wish to secure for
himself by bribes and caresses a peaceful
home and an amiable wife. In conclusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>it was added that Monica, in return for all
that had been done for her, must do her
utmost to please and gratify him. Of
course he would wish to show his beautiful
wife in the world of fashion to which
he belonged. He would wish her to join
in the life of social gaiety to which he
was about to introduce her, and any
hanging back on her part would be most
unbecoming and ungrateful. It behoved
her to keep in mind all these facts, to
remember the sacrifices he had made for
her, and to act accordingly. He had not
chosen a wife from his own world, as it
was presumable he would have preferred
to do. He had consented to the family
match proposed to him, and she must do
her utmost to make up to him for the
sacrifice he had made.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<p>A few weeks back such a letter, though
it might have hurt Monica’s pride, would
not have cut her to the quick, as it did
now. In the first place, she would then
have simply disbelieved it, whereas recent
circumstances had given her a very much
greater respect for the opinions of those
who knew the world so much better than
she did, and who had forecasted so
accurately events that had afterwards
fulfilled themselves almost as a matter of
course. She had begun to distrust her
own convictions, to believe more in those
of others, who had had experience of life,
and could estimate its chances better than
she could. She believed her aunt when
she told her these things, and the poisoned
shaft struck home to her heart. A few
days ago she could have borne it better.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>Her pride would have been hurt, but the
sting would have been less keen. She did not
know why the doubt of her husband’s love
hurt her so cruelly; but hurt her it did,
and for a moment she felt stricken to the
earth. She had said to herself many times
that she did not want such a wealth of love,
when she had none on her side to bestow;
but yet, when she had learned that it was
not hers after all, but was only the
counterfeit coin of a hollow world—the
bribe by which her submission and gratitude
were to be obtained—the knowledge
was unspeakably bitter. She felt she
would rather have died than have been
forced to doubt.</p>

<p>As she dressed for her ride, pride came
to the assistance of her crushed spirit.
Wilberforce, the faithful servant who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>tended and loved Randolph from his
infancy, and was ready to love his wife for
his sake and her own, was aware of a
subtle change in her young mistress that
she did not understand, and which she
could not well have described. Monica
had been very quiet and gentle since her
arrival, and very silent too. She was quiet
enough to-day; but the gentleness had
been replaced by a certain inexplicable
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hauteur</i>. The pale face wore a glow of
warm colour; the dark eyes that had been
languid and heavy were wide open
and full of fire. Monica looked superbly
handsome in the brilliant radiance of her
beauty, and yet the faithful attendant was
not certain that she liked the change
in her.</p>

<p>Randolph detected it the moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>he entered the room, and found his wife
equipped for the proposed ride.</p>

<p>“Why, Monica,” he said, smiling, “you
have got quite a colour. It looks natural
to see you dressed for the saddle.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered, coolly: “we must
turn over a new leaf now, must we not?
You will be dying of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i> cooped up at
home so long. Let us go out and enjoy
ourselves. We must learn to do in Rome
as Rome does.”</p>

<p>Randolph felt one keen pang of disappointment
that the first return to health
and strength should have brought a return of
the former coldness and aloofness; but he
had gained ground before, and why not now?
Could he expect to win his way without a
single repulse? So he took courage, and
tried to ignore the change he saw in his wife.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p>He led her down the staircase to the hall
door where the horses were waiting, and
he saw the sudden flash of joyful recognition
that crossed her face.</p>

<p>“Guy!” she exclaimed, “my own little
Guy!”</p>

<p>Yes, there could be no mistake about it;
it was her own little delicate thorough-bred,
standing with ill-repressed excitement at the
door, his glossy neck arched in a sort of
proud impatience, his supple limbs trembling
with eagerness, as he stepped daintily to
and fro upon the pavement. He turned
his shapely head at the sound of Monica’s
voice, pricked his ears, and uttered a low
whinney of joyful recognition.</p>

<p>“It was good of you to think of it,
Randolph,” she said, a softer light in her
eyes as she turned them towards her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>husband. “It is like a little bit of home
having him.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would like him better
than a stranger, though I have his counterpart
in the stable waiting for you to try.
He has been regularly exercised in Piccadilly
every morning, and I coaxed him to let me
ride him once myself in the Park, though
he did not much like it. I don’t think he
will be very troublesome now, and I know
you are not afraid of his restive moods;
though this is very different from Trevlyn.”</p>

<p>Monica’s eyes grew wistful, and her
husband saw it. He guessed whither her
thoughts had fled, and he let her dream
on undisturbed. He exchanged bows with
many acquaintances as they passed onwards
and entered the Row, and many admiring
glances were levelled at his beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>young wife, whose unusual loveliness and
perfect horsemanship alike attracted attention;
but he attempted no introductions;
and Monica, dreamy and absorbed, noticed
nothing, till the sight of Conrad in the
Row awoke her to consciousness of her
surroundings.</p>

<p>Conrad in London! How long had he
been there? Did he bring news from
Trevlyn? She looked almost wistfully at
Randolph as she returned the young
baronet’s bow, but his face wore its rather
stern expression, and she dared not attempt
to speak with her former friend.</p>

<p>Conrad, however, saw the look, and
smiled to himself.</p>

<p>“My day will come yet,” he said.</p>

<p>“Shall we push on, Monica?” asked Randolph.
“Guy is aching to stretch his limbs.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>Monica was only too willing, and they
had soon reached the farther end of the
Row, which was much less full than the
other had been.</p>

<p>A pretty, dark, vivacious looking girl,
accompanied by a fair-haired young man,
rather like her, were approaching with
glances of recognition.</p>

<p>“Randolph, I am angry with you—yes,
very angry. You have been a whole fortnight
in town—I heard so yesterday—and
we have never seen you once, and you
have never let me have the pleasure of
an introduction to your wife. I call it
very much too bad!”</p>

<p>“Well, it is never too late to mend,”
answered Randolph, smiling. “Monica,
may I present to you Lady Beatrice Wentworth,
whom I have had the honour of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>knowing intimately since the days of our
early acquaintance, when she wore pinafores
and pigtails. Lord Haddon, I think I
need not introduce again. You have met
before.”</p>

<p>The little flush deepened in Monica’s face.
She had fancied the face of the brother
was not totally unfamiliar to her; but
she did not remember until this moment
where or when she could possibly have
seen him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Haddon has been raving about
Lady Monica ever since the auspicious day
when he saw her,” cried Beatrice, gaily.
“I hope your father is quite recovered
now?” she added, with a touch of quick
sympathy, “since you were able to leave
him so soon.”</p>

<p>“I think he is much better, thank you,”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>answered Monica, quietly; “but he was
still very ill when I left him.”</p>

<p>“And, Randolph, you have not explained
away your guilt yet. Why have you been
all this time without letting us see you or
your wife? I call it shameful!”</p>

<p>“My wife has been very unwell herself
ever since we came up,” answered Randolph.
“She has not been fit to see anybody.”</p>

<p>“You should have made an exception in
my favour,” persisted Beatrice, bringing
her horse alongside of Monica’s, and walking
on with her. “You see, I have known
Randolph so long, he seems almost like a
brother. I feel defrauded when he does
not behave himself as such. We must be
great friends, Lady Monica, for his sake.
He has told us all about you and your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>delightful Cornish home. I suppose you
know all about us, too, and what near neighbours
we are—near for London, at least.”</p>

<p>But Monica had never heard the name of
the girl beside her. She knew nothing of
her husband’s friends, never having taken
the least interest in subjects foreign to
all her past associations. She hinted something
of the kind in a gently indifferent
way, that was sincere, without being in the
least discourteous. She was wondering
why it was that her husband, who could
value his own friends and appreciate their
good-will, was so strenuously set against
receiving the only acquaintance she
possessed in this vast city.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when, upon a forenoon
two days later, at an hour she knew her
husband was away, Conrad presented him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>self
in her boudoir, following the man who
had brought his card without waiting to be
invited, Monica was conscious of a feeling
of distinct displeasure and distrust. She
knew very little of the ways of the world,
but she felt that he had no right to be
there, forcing himself upon her in her
private room, when her husband would
hardly speak to him or receive him, and
that he merited instant dismissal.</p>

<p>But then came a revulsion of feeling.
Was he not her childhood’s friend? Had
she not promised not to turn her back
upon him, and help to drive him to despair
by her coldness? Had he not come with
news of Trevlyn and of home? And
in that last eager thought all else was
lost, and she met him gladly, almost
eagerly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<p>He told her all she longed to know. He
came primed with the latest news from
Trevlyn. His manner was quiet and
gentle. He was very cautious not to alarm
or disturb her.</p>

<p>“I shall not be able to see much of you
in the future, Monica,” he said, “but
you will let me call myself still your
friend?”</p>

<p>She bent her head in a sort of assent.</p>

<p>“And will you let me take a friend’s
privilege, and ask one question. Are you
happy in your new life?”</p>

<p>Monica’s face took a strange expression.</p>

<p>“It is very gay, very lively. I shall like
it better as I get more used to it.”</p>

<p>“I see,” he answered, very gently, “I
understand. And when are you going
home again?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<p>“I am at home now,” she answered,
steadily.</p>

<p>He looked searchingly at her.</p>

<p>“I thought Trevlyn was to be always
home. Has he thrown off the mask so
soon?”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Monica, with a little
gleam in her eye, “that you forget you are
speaking of my husband.”</p>

<p>Conrad’s eyes gleamed too; but she did
not see it.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Monica; I did forget. It
is all so strange and sudden. Then he
makes you happy? Tell me that! Let me
have the assurance that at least he makes
his captive happy.”</p>

<p>She started a little; but Conrad’s face
expressed nothing but the quietest, sincerest
good-will and sympathy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>
<p>“He is very, very good to me,” she said,
quietly. “He studies me as I have never
been studied before. All my wishes are
forestalled: he thinks of everything, he
does everything. I cannot tell you how
good he is. I have never known anything
like it before. Did you ever see anyone
more surrounded by beauty and luxury
than I am?”</p>

<p>He looked at her steadily. She knew
that she had evaded his question—a question
he had no right to put, as she could
not but feel—and that he knew she had
done so.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he murmured, “the gilded cage,
the gilded cage; but only a cage, after all.
Monica, forgive me for expressing a doubt;
but I know the man so well, and my whole
soul revolts at seeing you dragged as it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>were at his chariot wheels for all the world
to look at and admire. To take you from
your wild free home, and bribe you into
submission—I hate to think of it!”</p>

<p>Monica’s cheek had flushed suddenly;
but before she could frame a rejoinder the
door opened to admit Randolph. He
carried in his hand some hot-house flowers,
which he had brought for his wife. He
stopped short when he saw who was
Monica’s guest, and her cheek flamed anew,
for she knew he would not understand how
she came to receive him in her private
room, and she felt that by a want of firmness
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir faire</i> she had allowed herself
to be placed in a false position.</p>

<p>Conrad’s exit was effected with more
despatch than dignity, yet he contrived in
his farewell words to insinuate that he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>passed a very happy morning with his
hostess, instead of a brief ten minutes.</p>

<p>Randolph did not speak a word, but
stood leaning against the chimney-piece
with a stern look on his handsome face.
Monica was angry with herself and with
Conrad, yet she felt half indignant at the
way her husband ignored her guest.</p>

<p>“Monica,” said Randolph, speaking first,
“I am sorry to have to say it; but I cannot
receive Sir Conrad Fitzgerald as a guest
beneath my roof.”</p>

<p>“You had better give your orders, then,
accordingly.”</p>

<p>He stepped forward and took her hand.</p>

<p>“Surely, Monica, you cannot have any
real liking for this man?”</p>

<p>“I do not know what you call real
liking. We have been friends from child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>hood;
and I do not easily change. He was
always welcomed to my father’s house.”</p>

<p>“Your father did not know his history.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not; but I do. At least I
know this much: that he has sinned and
has repented. Is not repentance enough?”</p>

<p>“<em>Has</em> he repented?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed he has.”</p>

<p>Randolph’s face expressed a fine
incredulity and scorn. There was no
relenting in its lines. Monica was not
going to sue longer.</p>

<p>“Am I also to be debarred from seeing
Cecilia, his sister, who is married, and not
living so very far away? Am I to give
her up, too—my old playmate?”</p>

<p>“I have nothing against Mrs. Bellamy,
except that she is his sister. I suppose you
need not be very intimate?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<p>Monica’s overwrought feelings vented
themselves in a burst of indignation.</p>

<p>“I see what you want to do—to separate
me from all my friends—to break all old
ties—to make me forget all but your
world, your life. I am to like your friends,
to receive them, and be intimate with them;
but I am to turn my back with scorn on
all whom I have known and loved. You
are very hard, Randolph, very hard. It is
not that I care for Conrad—I know he has
done wrong, though I do believe in his
repentance. I liked him once, and Cecilia
too; I should like to know them still. They
are not much to me, but they belong to
the old life—which you do not—which
nothing does here. Can you not see how
hard it is, and how unjust, to try and cut
me off from everything?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>
<p>He looked at her with a great pity in
his eyes, and then gently put the flowers
into her hand.</p>

<p>“I brought them for you to wear to-night,
Monica. Will you have them?
Believe me, my child, I would do much to
spare you pain, yet in some things I must
be the judge. Some day, perhaps, I shall
be able to make my meaning plain; meantime
I must ask my wife to trust me.” He
stooped and kissed her pale brow, and went
away without another word.</p>

<p>Monica stood still and silent, the fragrant,
spotless blossoms, his gift, clasped close in
her hands.</p>

<p>“Randolph, Randolph!” she murmured,
“if you only loved me I could bear anything;
but they all see it—only I am blind—it
is the golden cage with its captive, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>they know the ways of their world so well,
so well! He bribes me with gifts, with
kind words, but it is only the peaceful home
and the handsome wife that he wants—not
me myself, not my heart, my love. Well,
he shall have what he craves. I will not
disappoint him. I will do his bidding in
all things. He has got his prize—let that
content him—but for the wifely love, the
wifely trust I have striven so to offer—he
does not care for them—let them go, like
these.” She pressed the flowers for a
moment to her lips, and then flung them
from the open casement.</p>

<p>Randolph, lost in silent thought, standing
at a window below, saw the white blossoms
as they fell to the earth, and knew what
they were and whence they had come.</p>

<h2 title="11. THE LITTLE RIFT">CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH.<br />

<small>THE LITTLE RIFT.</small></h2></div>


<p>A little misunderstanding easily arises
between two people not yet in perfect
accord—so very soon arises, and is so
difficult to lay to rest.</p>

<p>Randolph saw plainly now, that Monica’s
late gentleness had been caused simply by
exhaustion and ill-health. She had submitted
to his caressing care merely because
she had been too weak to resist, but the first
indication of restored health had been the
effort to repel him. He was grieved and
saddened by this conviction, but he accepted
his fate with quiet patience. He would
draw back a little, stand aside, as it were,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>and let her feel her way in the new life; and
win her confidence, if he could, by slow
and imperceptible degrees. He did not
despair of winning her yet. He had had
more than one of those rapturous moments
when he had felt that she was <em>almost</em> his.
He would not give up, but he would be
more self-restrained and reserved. He
would not attempt too much at once.</p>

<p>Monica was keenly conscious of the
change in her husband’s manner, though
she could not understand why it was that
it cut her so deeply. She was conscious of
the great blank in her life, and though her
face was always calm and quiet, her manner
gently cold and tinged with sadness, yet
she tried in all things to study her husband’s
wishes, and to follow out any hints
he might let fall as to his tastes and feelings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>
<p>She made no effort to see anything of
Cecilia Bellamy, her former child-friend,
and even when that vivacious little woman
sought her out, and tried to strike up
a great friendship, she did not respond
with any ardour. Mrs. Bellamy, indeed,
was not at all a woman that Monica would
be inclined to cultivate at this crisis of her
life; they had almost nothing in common,
but the past was a sort of link that could
not entirely be broken. Cecilia appeared
to love to talk of Trevlyn; she was always
eager to hear the latest news from thence,
to recall the by-gone days of childhood,
and bring back the light and colour to
Monica’s face by reminiscences of the past.</p>

<p>But the young wife tried to be loyal
to her husband’s wishes, and was laughed
at by her friend for her “old fashioned”
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>ways. Once, when in course of conversation,
Conrad’s name was mentioned between
them, Monica asked, in her straightforward
way, what it was that he had done to draw
upon him censure and distrust.</p>

<p>“Why, do you not even know that
much? Poor boy! I will tell you all
about it. He was very young, and you
know we are miserably poor. He got
into bad company, and that led him into
frightful embarrassments. He got so
miserable and desperate at last that I
believe his mind was almost unhinged for
a time, and in the end,” lowering her voice
to a whisper, “he forged a cheque in the
name of a rich friend. Of course it was a
mad thing to do. He paid his debts, but
the fraud was discovered within a few weeks,
and you know what <em>might</em> have happened.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>Colonel Hamilton, however, who had been
a kind friend to Conrad before, forgave
him, and took no steps against him; and
the poor boy was so shocked and humiliated
that he quite turned over a new leaf, and
has been perfectly steady ever since. He
was working hard to pay off the debt, but
Colonel Hamilton died before he could do
so. Randolph Trevlyn, your husband, my
dear, was intimate with the Colonel, and
knew all about this. He had always
disliked Conrad—I suspect they were
rivals once in the affections of some lady,
and that he did not get the best of the
rivalry—and I always believe it was
through him that the story leaked out. At
any rate, people did hear something, and
poor Conrad got dreadfully cold-shouldered.
He had always been wild and reckless, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>people are so fond of hitting a man when
he is down. But I call it very unkind and
unjust, and I did think that an old friend
like you would be above it. It hurts Conrad
dreadfully to find you so cold to him. I
should have thought you would have liked to
help him to recover the ground he had lost.”</p>

<p>“That can hardly be my office now,”
said Monica, gravely.</p>

<p>“But at least you need not be unkind.
I do assure you the poor boy has gone
through quite enough, as it is.”</p>

<p>“You have told me the whole truth
about his past, Cecilia?” asked Monica,
after a brief silence. “There is nothing
worse you are keeping back?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bellamy clasped her hands together
with a little gesture of astonished dismay.</p>

<p>“Is not forgery bad enough for you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>Monica? What <em>has</em> your husband been
telling you? Did you think he had committed
a murder?”</p>

<p>Monica left Mrs. Bellamy’s presence
somewhat relieved in mind. She was glad
to know the secret of Conrad’s past, the
cause of her husband’s disdain and distrust
of the man. It was natural, she thought,
that Randolph, as a friend of Colonel
Hamilton’s, should feel deep indignation at
the ingratitude and treachery of the fraud,
and yet she felt a sort of relief that it was
nothing blacker and baser. She had begun
to have an undefined feeling, since she had
entered somewhat into the tumultuous life
of the great world, that there were depths
of folly and sin and crime beneath its
smooth, polished surface, of whose very
existence she had never dreamed before.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p>When she returned home that day, and
said from whose house she had just come,
she fancied a shade gathered on her husband’s
brow. “Do you not go there rather
often, Monica?”</p>

<p>“We were friends as children,” she
said. “Am I to give up everything that
seems connected with the past—with my
home?”</p>

<p>“I lay no embargo upon you, Monica,”
he said; “or at least only one: I cannot
permit Sir Conrad Fitzgerald to visit my
wife, nor enter my house. If his sister is
your friend, and you wish to continue the
friendship, I say nothing against it. You
shall be the judge whether or not you visit
at a house your husband cannot enter, and
run the risk of meeting a man whose hand
he can never touch. You shall do exactly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>as you wish in the matter. I leave you
entire liberty.”</p>

<p>A flush rose slowly in Monica’s face.</p>

<p>“I want to do what is right to every
one,” she said. “You put things very
hardly, Randolph. You only see one side,
and even that you view very harshly. I
have heard Conrad’s story; it is very painful
and shameful; but he has repented—he
has indeed, and done all he could to
make amends. I have been taught that
repentance makes atonement, even in
God’s sight. I cannot sit in judgment
then, and condemn him utterly.”</p>

<p>Randolph looked at her keenly.</p>

<p>“Do you know all?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered steadily, “I know
all. It is very bad; but he has repented.”</p>

<p>“I have seen no signs of repentance.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>
<p>“Have you ever given yourself the
chance to do so?”</p>

<p>He was still gazing earnestly at her.</p>

<p>“Monica,” he said, very gravely, “be
advised by me. Do not make yourself
Fitzgerald’s champion.”</p>

<p>“I do not intend,” she answered, coldly,
“but neither will I be his judge.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, then
Randolph spoke.</p>

<p>“We will discuss this question no
further. It is a painful one for me. I
can never meet that man in friendship; I
could wish that you could be content to
forget him too; but he is an old friend.
You are not connected with the dark
passages in his life, and if his repentance is
sincere I will not forbid your meeting him
or speaking to him, if you find yourself in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>his company. It goes against me, I confess,
Monica. But I do not feel I have the right
to say more. If you are acquainted with
the story of his life, you are able to form
your own estimate of his deserts.”</p>

<p>The subject ended there, but it left a sort
of sore constraint in the minds of both. It
was almost with a feeling of relief a few
mornings later that Randolph opened a letter
from the bailiff of his Scotch estate, requesting
the presence of the master for a few
days. The young man had been getting
his shooting-box renovated and beautified
for the reception of his young wife, hoping
to prevail upon her in the autumn to come
north with him, and his own presence on
the spot had become a matter of necessity.</p>

<p>Monica heard of his proposed absence
with perfect quietness, which, however, hid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>a good deal of sinking at heart. She did
not venture to ask to accompany him, nor
did she suggest, as he had half feared,
returning to Trevlyn. She assented quietly
to the proposition, and gave no outward
sign of dismay.</p>

<p>Randolph sighed as he noted her indifference.
Once she would have dreaded being
left alone in the strange world of London,
have begged him not to leave her, but now
she was quite happy to see him depart. He
was gradually growing sorrowfully convinced
that his marriage had been a great
mistake, and that Monica’s love would
never be his. There had been sweet
moments both before and after marriage,
but they were few and far between, and
the hope he had once so ardently cherished
was growing fainter every day.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>
<p>However, life must go on in its accustomed
groove, and the night before his
departure was spent with Beatrice and her
brother, who were giving a select dinner
party. Randolph and Monica seldom spent
an evening at home alone now.</p>

<p>Beatrice Wentworth’s little parties were
very popular. She was an excellent
hostess, her endless sparkle and flow of
spirit kept her guests well amused, and
she treated her numerous admirers with a
provoking friendliness and equality that
was diverting to witness. Lord Haddon
was a favourite, too, from his good-natured
simplicity and frankness; and there was an
easy unconstrained atmosphere about their
house that made it a pleasant place of
resort to its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">habitués</i>.</p>

<p>Monica had grown fond of Beatrice, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>her quiet, undemonstrative fashion, and
felt more at home in her house than in any
other. Sometimes when those two were
alone together Beatrice would lay aside
that brilliant sparkle and flow of spirit, and
lapse into a sudden gravity and seriousness
that would have astonished many of her
friends and acquaintances had they chanced
to witness it. Sometimes Monica fancied at
such moments that some kind of cloud
rested upon the handsome, dashing girl,
that her past held some tear-stained page,
some sad or painful memory; and it was
this conviction that had won Monica’s confidence
and friendship more than anything
else. She could not make a true friend of
any one who had never known sorrow.</p>

<p>To-night Monica was unusually <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distraite</i>,
sad and heavy at heart, she hardly knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>why; finding it unusually difficult to talk
or smile, or to hide from the eyes of others
the melancholy that oppressed her. She
felt a strange craving for her husband’s
presence. She wanted him near her. She
longed to return to those first days of
married life, when his compassion for her
made him so tender, when he was always
with her, and she believed that he loved
her. Sometimes she had been almost happy
then, despite the wrench from the old
associations and the strangeness of all
around. Now she was always sad and
heavy-hearted; and to-night she was
curiously oppressed.</p>

<p>It was only at this house that she could
ever be persuaded to sing, and to-night it
was not till the end of the evening that
Lord Haddon’s entreaties prevailed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>her. She rose at last and crossed to the
piano, and sitting down without any music
before her, sang a simple melodious setting
to some words of Christina Rossetti’s:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“When I am dead, my dearest,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">Sing no sad songs for me;</div>
      <div class="verse">Plant thou no roses at my head,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">Nor shady cypress-tree.</div>
      <div class="verse">Be the green grass above me,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">With showers and dew-drops wet;</div>
      <div class="verse">And if thou wilt, remember—</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">And if thou wilt, forget.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“I shall not see the shadows,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">I shall not feel the rain;</div>
      <div class="verse">I shall not hear the nightingale,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">Sing on as if in pain.</div>
      <div class="verse">But dreaming through the twilight,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">Which doth not rise nor set,</div>
      <div class="verse">I haply may remember—</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">And haply may forget.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As she sang, the room, the company, all
faded from her view and from her mind—all
but Randolph. One strange longing
filled her soul—the longing that she might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>indeed lie sleeping and at rest in some
quiet, wind-swept spot, her spirit hovering
free—to see if her husband ever came to
stand beside that grave, to see if he would
in such a case remember—or forget.</p>

<p>For herself Monica, knew well that
remembrance would be her portion. She
never could forget.</p>

<p>There was a wonderful sweetness and
pathos in her voice as she sang. The
listeners held their breath, and sudden
tears started to Beatrice’s eyes. When the
last note had died away, Randolph crossed
the room and laid his hand upon his wife’s
shoulder. There was a subdued murmur
all through the room, but she only heard
her husband’s voice.</p>

<p>“That was very sweet, Monica,” he said
gently. “I have never heard it before;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>but you make it sound so unutterably
sad.”</p>

<p>She looked up at him wistfully.</p>

<p>“I think sad songs are always sweetest—they
are more like life, at least.”</p>

<p>His eyes were very full of tenderness;
she saw it, and it almost unmanned her.</p>

<p>“I am so tired, Randolph; will you take
me home? The carriage will not be here,
but it is such a little way. I should like
best to walk.”</p>

<p>A very few moments later they were out
in the warm, spring air, under the twinkling
stars. She held his arm closely. Her hand
trembled a little, he fancied. He drew her
light lace wrap more closely round her,
thinking she felt chilled. At this little
mark of thoughtfulness she looked up at
him with a tremulous smile.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p>“I shall miss you when you are gone,
Randolph,” she said, softly. “You will
not be long away?”</p>

<p>His heart beat high, but his words were
very quietly spoken.</p>

<p>“No Monica, only four or five days.”</p>

<p>“And you will take care of yourself?
You will come back safe—you will not get
into any danger!”</p>

<p>“Why no,” he answered with a smile.
“Danger! What are you thinking about,
Monica?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Sometimes my heart is
very heavy. It is heavy to-night. Promise you
will take care of yourself—for my sake.”</p>

<p>Randolph did not, after all, go away
quite comfortless.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
